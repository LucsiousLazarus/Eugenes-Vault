## Overview

An accrual in accounting represents revenues or expenses that have been recognized but not yet received or paid. The accrual concept is a fundamental principle in accounting, adhering to the [[Accrual Accounting]] method, which dictates that financial events are recognized in the books when they occur, rather than when cash transactions take place.

## Key Concepts

1. **Accrued Expense:** An accrued expense refers to an expense that has been incurred but not yet paid. For example, if a company received services from a supplier but has not yet received the invoice, the company would record an accrued expense and a corresponding liability.
    
2. **Accrued Revenue:** Conversely, accrued revenue refers to revenue that has been earned but not yet received. For example, if a company provided services to a client but has not yet invoiced the client, the company would record accrued revenue and a corresponding asset.
    

## Accounting Treatment

Accruals form part of the adjustment process when preparing financial statements at the end of an accounting period. They ensure that all income and expenses are recorded within the correct period. The entries for accruals involve both income statement and balance sheet accounts.

For instance, an accrual for wages expense that has been incurred but not yet paid would involve the following journal entries:

- Debit (increase) Wages Expense (an income statement account)
- Credit (increase) Wages Payable (a balance sheet account)

## Accruals vs. Deferrals

While accruals recognize economic events before cash is exchanged, deferrals are the opposite. They delay the recognition of revenue or expense until after cash has been received or paid. Both accruals and deferrals aim to ensure that revenues and expenses are recognized in the period to which they relate, aligning with the matching principle in accounting.

## Impact on Financial Statements

The application of the accrual concept affects several items on the financial statements:

1. **Income Statement:** It ensures that all revenues and expenses relating to the current period, whether cash has been received or paid or not, are recorded.
    
2. **Balance Sheet:** It ensures that all obligations (liabilities) and rights (assets) at the end of the period are recognized.
    
3. **Cash Flow Statement:** Accruals are adjusted in the operating activities section to reflect the actual cash flow.
