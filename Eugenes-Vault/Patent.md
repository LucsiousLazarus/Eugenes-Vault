## Overview

A [[Patent]] is a type of intellectual property right that provides its owner with a temporary monopoly over a specific invention. It grants the owner the exclusive right to prevent others from making, using, selling, or importing the patented invention without the owner's consent.

## Types of Patents

There are three types of patents:

1. **Utility Patent:** This covers new and useful processes, machines, manufactures, or compositions of matter. These are the most common type of patent.
    
2. **Design Patent:** This covers new, original, and ornamental designs for an article of manufacture.
    
3. **Plant Patent:** This covers new and distinct, invented or discovered asexually reproduced plants including cultivated sports, mutants, hybrids, and newly found seedlings, other than a tuber propagated plant or a plant found in an uncultivated state.
    

## Economic Impact

Patents can have significant economic impacts. They incentivize innovation by providing inventors with a means of profiting from their inventions. In addition, they promote knowledge dissemination, as patents require public disclosure of the invention in exchange for the granted monopoly rights.

## Patent Application

Securing a patent involves submitting an application to the national or regional patent office. The application must include a description of the invention sufficient for someone skilled in the art to recreate it, along with one or more claims defining the scope of the invention.

## Patent Enforcement

Patents are enforced in a court, which, in most systems, holds the authority to stop patent infringement. Conversely, the court also has the authority to declare a patent invalid upon a successful challenge by a defendant in an infringement lawsuit.
