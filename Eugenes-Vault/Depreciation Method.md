## Overview

Depreciation is an accounting method of allocating the cost of a tangible or physical asset over its useful life or life expectancy. It represents how much of an asset's value has been used up. Businesses depreciate long-term assets for both tax and accounting purposes. There are various methods to calculate depreciation, each of which may impact a company's net income, taxable income, and cash flow.

## Key Concepts

1. **Straight-Line Depreciation Method:** This is the most commonly used and straightforward depreciation method. The company estimates the salvage value of the asset at the end of its useful life and subtracts that from the asset's cost. The balance is then divided by the number of years in the asset's estimated useful life.
    
2. **Double Declining Balance Depreciation Method:** This is an accelerated depreciation method. It counts depreciation at twice the rate of the straight line method.
    
3. **Units of Production Depreciation Method:** This method is based on the usage, activity, or parts produced by the asset rather than the passage of time. The company will estimate the asset’s total units of production capacity in its lifetime, then, each year, use the asset's actual production to calculate depreciation.
    
4. **Sum of the Years' Digits Depreciation Method:** This is another accelerated depreciation method. The denominator is determined by adding up the number of years of the asset’s useful life.
    

## Importance of Depreciation Method in Business

Choosing the right depreciation method is important as it can affect a company's financial and tax situation. Accelerated depreciation methods, like the double declining balance and sum of the years' digits, can lead to higher expenses initially, which reduces taxable income. On the other hand, the straight-line method is simpler and spreads out the cost evenly over the asset's life.

## Impact on Cash Flow

It's important to remember that depreciation is a non-cash expense. This means it does not directly impact cash flow. However, it does reduce the company's taxable income. As the company's taxable income is lowered, the company's total tax expense is reduced, which improves cash flow.
