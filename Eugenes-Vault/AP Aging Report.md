## Overview

An AP Aging Report (Accounts Payable Aging Report) is an accounting tool that visualizes a company's outstanding bills. It categorizes amounts owed to suppliers based on the length of time an invoice has been outstanding in the company’s system.

## Purpose of AP Aging Report

The main purpose of an AP Aging Report is to help businesses manage their cash flow and pay their bills on time. It also allows management to identify any suppliers that need to be paid immediately or any invoices that may be disputed. Moreover, it's an important tool for auditing, as it shows the due diligence of a company in managing its financial obligations.

## Structure of AP Aging Report

Typically, an AP Aging Report is broken down into columns that represent different time periods:

1.  Current: This column lists all the invoices that are not yet due.
2.  1-30 days: This column includes all the invoices that are 1 to 30 days past due.
3.  31-60 days: Invoices that are 31 to 60 days past due are listed here.
4.  61-90 days: This column is for the invoices that are 61 to 90 days overdue.
5.  90+ days: Invoices that are over 90 days past due are listed in this column.

Each supplier’s name will be listed on the report along with the amounts they are owed in each time bracket. The report also includes the total amount owed to each supplier.

## Impact on Business Operations

An efficiently managed Accounts Payable department, reflected in the AP Aging Report, can lead to improved relationships with suppliers, potential for better pricing and terms, and a better credit rating. Conversely, mismanaged payables can lead to strained supplier relationships, loss of supplier credit, and potentially damaging a company's credit rating.
