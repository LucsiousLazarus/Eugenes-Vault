## Overview

A brokerage is a firm or an individual that acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers, usually for a commission. The most common types of brokerages operate in the financial industry and deal in securities such as stocks, bonds, and other investment products.

## Key Concepts

1. **Stock Brokerage:** Stock brokerages buy and sell [[Stocks]] and other securities on behalf of their clients, typically charging a commission or a fee for the service. They can provide a range of services from executing trades to offering investment advice and portfolio management.
    
2. **Real Estate Brokerage:** Real estate brokerages facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers or landlords and tenants of real estate properties. The brokerage earns a commission once a transaction is completed, typically paid by the seller or landlord.
    
3. **Insurance Brokerage:** Insurance brokerages work with clients to find the best insurance policies to suit their needs, from a range of insurance providers. They earn a commission from the insurance company once a policy is sold.
    

## Types of Brokerages

1. **Full-Service Brokerage:** These brokerages provide a variety of services to their clients beyond just the buying and selling of securities. These services can include research and advice, retirement planning, tax tips, and more.
    
2. **Discount Brokerage:** These brokerages conduct transactions on behalf of their clients without providing additional services. Their fees are lower than those of full-service brokerages, hence the term "discount."
    
3. **Online Brokerage:** Online or electronic brokerages are platforms that allow investors to buy and sell securities over the internet. They typically offer lower fees than traditional brokerages.
    

## Regulation

Brokerages are heavily regulated to protect investors. In the United States, for example, brokerages must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and are regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).

## Role in the Financial System

Brokerages play a crucial role in the financial system. They facilitate the efficient functioning of markets by enabling transactions between buyers and sellers, increasing liquidity, and assisting in price discovery.
