## Overview

The Time Value of Money (TVM) is a fundamental concept in finance and economics that states that a dollar received today is worth more than a dollar received in the future, due to the earning potential of money over time. The TVM concept is essential in various areas of finance, including valuation, capital budgeting, retirement planning, and loan calculations.

## Key Components of TVM

1.  **[[Present Value (PV)]]**: The current value of a future cash flow, discounted to reflect the time value of money.
2.  **[[Future Value (FV)]]**: The value of a cash flow or investment at a specified point in the future, taking into account the time value of money.
3.  **[[Interest Rate]]**: The rate at which money grows over time when invested or borrowed.
4.  **Number of Periods**: The number of time periods (usually expressed in years) over which money is invested or borrowed.
5.  **[[Annuity]]**: A series of equal cash flows made at regular intervals over a specified period.

## TVM Formulas

1.  **[[Future Value of a Single Sum (FVSS)]]**: FV = PV * (1 + r)^n
    -   FV: future value
    -   PV: present value
    -   r: interest rate per period
    -   n: number of periods
2.  **[[Present Value of a Single Sum (PVSS)]]**: PV = FV / (1 + r)^n
3.  **[[Future Value of an Annuity (FVA)]]**: FVA = Pmt * (((1 + r)^n - 1) / r)
    -   Pmt: payment amount per period
4.  **[[Present Value of an Annuity (PVA)]]**: PVA = Pmt * ((1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r)

## Applications of TVM

1.  **[[Valuation]]**: TVM is used to determine the present value of future cash flows, which is essential for valuing investments, assets, and businesses.
2.  **[[Capital Budgeting]]**: Businesses use TVM to evaluate the potential profitability of investments by comparing the present value of expected future cash flows with the cost of the investment.
3.  **[[Retirement Planning]]**: TVM plays a crucial role in retirement planning, as it helps determine the amount of savings and investments required to achieve a specific financial goal in the future.
4.  **[[Loan and Mortgage Calculations]]**: TVM is used to calculate the interest and principal payments of loans and mortgages, as well as to determine the present value of the outstanding balance.
