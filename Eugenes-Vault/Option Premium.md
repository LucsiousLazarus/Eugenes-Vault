## Overview

The [[Option Premium]] is the cost or price that a buyer pays to the seller to have the choice to exercise an [[Options|option]]. It is the income received by the seller (or writer) of an option contract to another party.

## Factors Influencing Option Premium

1. **[[Intrinsic Value]]**: This is the value any given option would have if it were exercised today. Basically, the intrinsic value is the amount by which an option is in the money.
    
2. **[[Time Value]]**: This is the extra amount option buyers are willing to pay over the intrinsic value. This value reduces as the expiry date comes near ([[Time Decay]]).
    
3. **[[Volatility]]**: Greater the volatility of the underlying asset, higher the premium. This is because the chance of the option moving in the money increases with volatility, thus making it more valuable.
    
4. **Risk-Free Rate of Interest**: An increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase the premium of a call option and decrease the premium of a put option.
    
5. **Dividends**: Expected dividends reduce the price of a call and increase the price of a put.
    

## Calculating Option Premium

The most widely used models for option pricing are the [[Black-Scholes]] Model and the Binomial Model. Both models are based on the same theoretical foundations and assumptions such as the geometric Brownian motion of the stock price.
