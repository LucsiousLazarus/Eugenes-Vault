## Overview

[[Payment Frequency]] refers to the number of times payments are made over a certain period. This is most commonly seen in loans or other forms of credit, where repayment of the loan is broken up into multiple payments over time. The payment frequency can have an impact on the total amount of interest paid over the life of the loan.

## Common Payment Frequencies

There are several types of payment frequencies:

1. **Weekly:** Payments are made every week, resulting in 52 payments per year.
    
2. **Bi-Weekly:** Payments are made every two weeks, resulting in 26 payments per year.
    
3. **Semi-Monthly:** Payments are made twice a month, typically on the 1st and 15th, resulting in 24 payments per year.
    
4. **Monthly:** Payments are made once a month, resulting in 12 payments per year.
    
5. **Quarterly:** Payments are made every three months, resulting in 4 payments per year.
    
6. **Semi-Annual:** Payments are made twice a year, resulting in 2 payments per year.
    
7. **Annual:** Payments are made once a year.
    

## Impact on Loan Repayment

The frequency of payments can affect the total amount of interest paid over the term of a loan, even if the interest rate is the same. The more frequently payments are made, the more often interest is calculated and added to the loan, which can result in lower overall interest costs. This is due to the [[Amortization]] process.

For example, if you have a $100,000 loan at 5% interest for a 30-year term, you would pay more interest over the life of the loan if you made monthly payments compared to weekly payments.
