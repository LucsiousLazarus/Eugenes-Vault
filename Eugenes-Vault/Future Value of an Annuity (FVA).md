## Overview

The Future Value of an Annuity (FVA) is the value of a series of equal cash flows (annuity) at a specific point in the future, taking into account the effects of compound interest. It is a useful concept in finance and investing to determine the future value of investments that generate periodic cash flows, such as retirement savings or recurring deposits.

## Formula

The formula for calculating the future value of an annuity is:

FVA = C * [((1 + r)^t - 1) / r]

-   FVA: future value of the annuity
-   C: cash flow per period
-   r: interest rate (in decimal) per period
-   t: total number of periods

## Example

Suppose an investor wants to determine the future value of an annuity that involves depositing $1,000 per year for 5 years, with an annual interest rate of 5%. Using the FVA formula:

FVA = $1,000 * [((1 + 0.05)^5 - 1) / 0.05] FVA â‰ˆ $5,525.63

The future value of the annuity after 5 years is approximately $5,525.63.

## Applications

1.  **Investment Evaluation**: FVA can be used to evaluate investments that generate periodic cash flows, such as recurring deposits or retirement savings, by comparing the future value of the cash flows to the required investment amount.
2.  **Retirement Planning**: FVA can be used to calculate the future value of a retirement savings plan that generates periodic income, helping individuals to plan for their future needs.
3.  **Budgeting and Financial Planning**: FVA can be used to estimate the future value of savings or investment plans, providing a basis for setting financial goals and making informed decisions.
