## Overview

[[Long-term Liabilities]], also known as non-current liabilities, are financial obligations of a company that are due more than one year into the future. These obligations are contrasted with current liabilities, which are due within one year.

## Examples of Long-term Liabilities

Some common types of long-term liabilities include:

- **Long-term debt**: This can include corporate bonds or notes payable that are due in more than one year.
- **Deferred tax liabilities**: These are taxes that a company owes but has not yet paid.
- **Pension liabilities**: These are obligations that a company has to pay into its employee pension plans.
- **Lease obligations**: These are commitments made under long-term lease agreements.
- **Long-term loans**: This includes loans from financial institutions that have a maturity of more than one year.

## Long-term Liabilities on the Balance Sheet

In the [[Balance Sheet]], long-term liabilities appear alongside current liabilities under the liabilities section. Their payment schedules and interest rates often vary by the type of liability and the issuing company.

## Importance of Long-term Liabilities

Long-term liabilities are important to both the company and its investors. For the company, these liabilities can provide the necessary capital to fund large investments. For investors, the size and nature of a company's long-term liabilities can provide insight into its financial health and risk profile. High levels of debt can indicate higher risk, while lower levels can indicate financial stability.
