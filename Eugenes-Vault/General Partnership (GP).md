## Overview

A General Partnership (GP) is a type of partnership in which two or more individuals or organizations come together to share ownership, management responsibilities, and profits or losses. In a General Partnership, all partners share equal rights and responsibilities in managing the business, and each partner is personally liable for the partnership's debts and obligations.

## Key Characteristics

1.  **Formation**: A General Partnership can be easily formed, often requiring only a written or verbal agreement between the partners. However, it is recommended to create a formal partnership agreement outlining the partners' roles, responsibilities, and financial contributions to avoid future disputes.
    
2.  **Ownership and Management**: In a General Partnership, ownership and management are shared among the partners. Each partner contributes capital, labor, or expertise to the business and has equal decision-making authority, unless otherwise specified in the partnership agreement.
    
3.  **Taxation**: A General Partnership is not a separate tax entity, which means that profits and losses are "passed through" to the partners and taxed at their individual tax rates. This can be advantageous for some business owners, as it avoids the double taxation that can occur with corporations.
    
4.  **Liability**: In a General Partnership, partners are personally responsible for the partnership's debts and obligations. This means that their personal assets can be at risk in the event of a lawsuit or financial difficulty. Each partner is considered an agent of the partnership and can bind the partnership in contracts and agreements.

## Dissolution

A General Partnership can be dissolved under several circumstances, including the withdrawal or death of a partner, the completion of a specific project, or the mutual agreement of all partners.
