## Overview

The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is a financial metric that is widely used in capital budgeting, business valuation, and investment analysis. IRR is the discount rate at which the [[Net Present Value (NPV)]] of a series of projected cash flows equals zero. In other words, IRR is the estimated rate of return that would make the present value of future cash flows plus the final market value of an investment or project equal its current market price.

## Calculation

The IRR is the rate "r" that satisfies the following equation:

0 = C0 + ∑ [CFt / (1 + r)^t]

where:

-   CFt is the net cash inflow during the period t
-   r is the internal rate of return
-   t is the number of time periods
-   C0 is the initial investment

Note that the equation requires iterative calculation, and there might be more than one solution if the cash flow sign changes more than once throughout the life of the project or investment.

## Interpretation

The IRR can be interpreted as follows:

-   **IRR > Required Rate of Return**: If the IRR of a project or investment exceeds the required rate of return (or the cost of capital), the project would likely add value and should be considered.
-   **IRR < Required Rate of Return**: If the IRR is less than the required rate of return, the project or investment would likely not add value and should be rejected.
-   **IRR = Required Rate of Return**: If the IRR equals the required rate of return, the project or investment would break even.

## Importance of IRR

IRR is used in finance for several reasons:

1.  **Capital Budgeting**: Companies use IRR to evaluate and compare the potential profitability of investments or projects.
2.  **Investment Decisions**: IRR can be used to rank multiple prospective projects on a relatively objective basis. The higher the IRR, the more desirable the project is.
3.  **Risk Assessment**: Like the NPV, IRR takes into account the time value of money. However, a project’s IRR is unique and doesn’t reflect changes in the risk environment, which is a limitation of this measure.
