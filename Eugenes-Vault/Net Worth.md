## Overview

Net worth is a financial metric used to evaluate an individual's, company's, or entity's financial health. It represents the difference between the total value of assets owned and the total value of liabilities owed. A positive net worth indicates that the value of assets exceeds liabilities, while a negative net worth indicates that liabilities are greater than assets.

## Key Concepts

1.  **[[Asset]]s**: Items of value that an individual or entity owns, such as cash, investments, real estate, vehicles, and personal possessions.
    
2.  **[[Liabilities]]**: Financial obligations or debts owed by an individual or entity, including loans, mortgages, credit card balances, and other payables.
    
3.  **[[Equity]]**: In the context of personal finance, equity refers to an individual's net worth. In business, equity refers to the ownership interest in a company, which is calculated as the difference between the company's assets and liabilities.
    
4.  **[[Balance Sheet]]**: A financial statement that presents a snapshot of an individual's or company's financial position at a specific point in time, showing the total value of assets, liabilities, and net worth (or equity).
    
5.  **[[Financial Planning]]**: Net worth is an essential component of financial planning, as it helps individuals and businesses assess their current financial health, set financial goals, and develop strategies to achieve those goals.
    

## Calculating Net Worth

To calculate net worth, follow these steps:

1.  List all assets and their current market values.
2.  List all liabilities and their current outstanding balances.
3.  Subtract the total value of liabilities from the total value of assets.

Net Worth = Total Assets - Total Liabilities

## Importance of Monitoring Net Worth

1.  **[[Financial Health Assessment]]**: Regularly tracking net worth helps individuals and businesses evaluate their financial health and progress toward achieving financial goals.
    
2.  **Goal Setting**: Monitoring net worth enables individuals and businesses to set realistic financial goals and make informed decisions about spending, saving, and investing.
    
3.  **[[Debt Management]]**: Keeping track of net worth can help individuals and businesses identify areas of excessive debt and develop strategies for reducing liabilities.
    
4.  **[[Retirement Planning]]**: Calculating net worth is an essential step in retirement planning, as it helps individuals determine how much they need to save and invest to achieve their desired retirement lifestyle.
    
5.  **[[Estate Planning]]**: Understanding net worth is crucial for estate planning, as it helps individuals and families plan for the distribution of assets and the settlement of liabilities upon death.
