## Overview

Dissolution is the legal ending of a business entity's existence. This can occur for a variety of reasons, including the decision of owners or shareholders, bankruptcy, the completion of a certain project or purpose, or the death or withdrawal of an owner in certain [[Business Structure]]s like [[Partnership]]s. Dissolution is typically followed by the process of liquidation, where the company's remaining [[Asset]]s are sold off to pay [[Creditor]]s, and any remaining amounts are distributed to the owners or shareholders.

## Dissolution Process

The process of dissolution can vary based on the type of business entity and the jurisdiction in which it is located, but generally involves the following steps:

1.  **Resolution to Dissolve**: The first step towards dissolution is usually a resolution to dissolve, passed by the owners or [[Shareholder]]s of the [[Business]]. In a [[Corporation]], for instance, this might require a majority or supermajority vote by the shareholders.
    
2.  **Filing of Dissolution Documents**: Once a resolution to dissolve has been passed, the business must typically file certain documents with the state, such as a certificate of dissolution or articles of dissolution.
    
3.  **Notification of [[Creditor]]s and [[Settlement of Claim]]s**: The business must notify its creditors that it is dissolving, and it must settle any claims that creditors have against it. This can involve paying off debts or disputing the claims in court.
    
4.  **[[Liquidation]] of [[Asset]]s**: After claims have been settled, the [[Business]]'s remaining assets are liquidated, or sold off. The proceeds from this liquidation are used to pay off any remaining debts.
    
5.  **Distribution of Remaining Assets**: Once all debts have been paid, any remaining assets are distributed to the owners or [[Shareholder]]s of the business, typically in proportion to their ownership [[Shares]].
    

## Dissolution in Different Business Entities

**[[Sole Proprietorship]]**: Dissolution is straightforward, as there are no partners or shareholders to consider. The owner simply decides to stop doing business and settles any remaining business debts.

**[[Partnership]]**: Dissolution can occur when a partner withdraws or dies, or when the partners agree to end the partnership. Partnerships also dissolve automatically on the completion of a certain project or purpose for which the partnership was formed.

**[[Corporation]]**: Dissolution generally requires a resolution to dissolve, passed by the corporation's shareholders. The corporation must then file articles of dissolution with the state, notify its creditors, settle claims, liquidate assets, and distribute any remaining assets to its shareholders.

**[[Limited Liability Company (LLC)]]**: The process for dissolving an LLC is similar to that for a corporation, but may be governed by the terms of the LLC's operating agreement.
