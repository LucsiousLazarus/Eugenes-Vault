## Overview

Supply is a fundamental concept in economics and refers to the quantity of goods or services that producers are willing and able to offer for sale at various price levels. The relationship between supply and price is often represented by a supply curve, which shows the quantity of a good or service that producers are willing to supply at each price level. Generally, the higher the price, the more goods or services will be supplied.

## Factors Influencing Supply

Several factors can influence the supply of a good or service, including:

1.  **Production costs**: Changes in production costs, such as labor, materials, or capital, can affect the supply of a good or service. If production costs rise, suppliers may be less willing to produce a good or service at current price levels, resulting in a decrease in supply.
    
2.  **Technology**: Improvements in technology can increase the productivity and efficiency of production, potentially leading to a higher supply of a good or service at a given price.
    
3.  **Government policies**: Government policies, such as taxes, subsidies, and regulations, can influence the supply of a good or service. For example, a subsidy may encourage production and increase supply, while a tax or regulation may increase production costs and reduce supply.
    
4.  **Producer expectations**: If producers expect future prices to rise, they may choose to hold back some of their current supply in anticipation of higher profits, reducing current supply levels.
    
5.  **Number of suppliers**: An increase in the number of suppliers of a good or service can lead to greater competition and increased supply.
    

## [[Law of Supply]]

The Law of Supply is an economic principle stating that there is a direct relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity supplied. As the price of a good or service increases, the quantity supplied will also increase, and as the price decreases, the quantity supplied will decrease, all other things being equal.

## Supply and Demand

Supply and demand are two fundamental concepts in economics that describe how the price and quantity of goods and services are determined in a market. The interaction of supply and demand leads to market equilibrium, where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded at a specific price level. Changes in supply or demand can cause shifts in the market equilibrium, resulting in changes to the price and quantity of goods and services traded.

## [[Elasticity of Supply]]

Elasticity of supply measures the responsiveness of the quantity supplied of a good or service to a change in its price. A good or service with a high elasticity of supply is more responsive to price changes, while a good or service with a low elasticity of supply is less responsive. Elasticity of supply can be influenced by factors such as the availability of resources, the time it takes to adjust production levels, and the level of competition among suppliers.
