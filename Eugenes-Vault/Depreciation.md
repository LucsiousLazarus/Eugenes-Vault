## Overview

Depreciation is the accounting process of allocating the cost of a tangible asset (such as property, plant, and equipment) over its useful life. This accounting method recognizes that fixed assets lose value as they age, wear out, or become obsolete. Depreciation helps businesses match the cost of using an asset with the revenue generated from that asset, providing a more accurate reflection of a company's financial performance.

## Types of Depreciation Methods

There are several methods to calculate depreciation, including:

1.  **[[Straight-Line Depreciation]]:** The most common method, it allocates the cost of an asset evenly over its useful life. The annual depreciation expense is calculated as (Cost - Residual Value) / Useful Life.
    
2.  **[[Declining Balance Depreciation]]:** This method uses a fixed percentage rate applied to the asset's remaining book value each year. It results in higher depreciation expenses in the early years of an asset's life and lower expenses in later years.
    
3.  **[[Sum-of-the-Years-Digits (SYD) Depreciation]]:** This method accelerates depreciation by applying a higher expense rate in the early years of an asset's life. It is calculated by multiplying the asset's depreciable cost by a fraction, with the numerator being the remaining life of the asset, and the denominator being the sum of the years' digits of the asset's useful life.
    
4.  **[[Units-of-Production Depreciation]]:** This method allocates the cost of an asset based on its usage, such as the number of units produced or the hours used. The depreciation expense is calculated as (Cost - Residual Value) / Total Units of Production Expected, multiplied by the actual units produced during the period.
    

## Factors Affecting Depreciation

-   **[[Cost]]:** The initial cost of the asset, including any expenses incurred to acquire and prepare the asset for use.
    
-   **[[Useful Life]]:** The estimated period during which the asset is expected to provide economic benefits to the business.
    
-   **[[Residual Value]]:** The estimated value of the asset at the end of its useful life, also known as the salvage value.
    
-   **[[Depreciation Method]]:** The method chosen to allocate the cost of the asset over its useful life.
    

## Impact on [[Financial Statement]]s

Depreciation affects a company's financial statements in the following ways:

-   [[Income Statement]]: Depreciation is recorded as an expense, reducing the company's net income.
    
-   **[[Balance Sheet]]:** Depreciation reduces the carrying amount of fixed assets on the balance sheet, reflecting the decline in their value over time.
    
-   **[[Cash Flow Statement]]:** Depreciation is added back to net income in the operating activities section, as it is a non-cash expense.
    

## Tax Implications

Depreciation can also have tax implications for businesses, as it is generally considered a tax-deductible expense. By reducing a company's taxable income, depreciation can lower its tax liability and improve cash flow.
