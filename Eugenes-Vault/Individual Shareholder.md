## Overview

An individual shareholder, also known as a retail investor, is a person who invests in stocks or other securities of publicly traded companies. These investors purchase shares of a company's stock in hopes of benefiting from the company's growth and profits, usually through capital appreciation and dividend income. Individual shareholders play an essential role in financial markets by contributing to the liquidity and price discovery process.

## Investing in the Stock Market

Individual shareholders typically invest in the stock market for various reasons, including:

-   **[[Capital]] [[Appreciation]]**: The potential for an increase in the value of their investments over time, leading to a higher net worth.
    
-   **[[Dividend Income]]**: Regular cash payments made by companies to their shareholders as a distribution of profits.
    
-   **Diversification**: Including stocks in a diversified investment portfolio can help to reduce risk and improve overall returns.
    
-   **Inflation hedge**: Investing in stocks can help protect against the eroding effects of inflation on purchasing power.
    

## Shareholder Rights

As owners of a portion of a company, individual shareholders have certain rights, which may include:

-   **Voting rights**: Shareholders are usually entitled to vote on various corporate matters, such as the election of the board of directors, mergers and acquisitions, and other significant decisions.
    
-   **Dividend payments**: Shareholders may receive a portion of the company's profits as dividends, depending on the company's dividend policy and the type of stock they own.
    
-   **Information access**: Shareholders have the right to receive essential financial information about the company, such as annual reports and financial statements.
    
-   **Limited liability**: Individual shareholders have limited liability, which means their financial responsibility is limited to the value of their investment in the company.

-   **Market risk**: The possibility that the overall stock market or a specific company's stock will decline in value.
    
-   **Liquidity risk**: The risk that an investor may not be able to sell their shares quickly and easily at a desirable price.
