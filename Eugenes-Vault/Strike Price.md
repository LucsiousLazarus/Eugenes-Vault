## Overview

The strike price, also known as the exercise price, is the predetermined price at which an option holder can buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset. Strike prices are an essential component of options contracts, as they determine the price at which the option holder can exercise their rights.

## Role in [[Call Option]]s

In a call option, the strike price represents the price at which the option holder can purchase the underlying asset. If the market price of the underlying asset is above the strike price, the call option is said to be "in the money." In this scenario, the option holder can exercise the option and buy the asset at the strike price, realizing an instant profit by selling the asset at the current market price. If the market price is below the strike price, the call option is "out of the money" and has no intrinsic value.

## Role in [[Put Option]]s

In a put option, the strike price represents the price at which the option holder can sell the underlying asset. If the market price of the underlying asset is below the strike price, the put option is "in the money." The option holder can exercise the option and sell the asset at the strike price, realizing an instant profit. If the market price is above the strike price, the put option is "out of the money" and has no intrinsic value.

## [[Option Pricing]]
]]
Strike prices play a crucial role in determining the value of an option. The difference between the strike price and the current market price of the underlying asset influences the option's intrinsic value. Options with strike prices closer to the current market price are generally more expensive because they have a higher probability of being in the money at expiration.

## Moneyness

The relationship between the strike price and the current market price of the underlying asset determines an option's moneyness. The three main categories of moneyness are:

1.  **[[In the Money (ITM)]]**: An option is in the money when it has intrinsic value. For call options, this occurs when the market price is above the strike price. For put options, this occurs when the market price is below the strike price.
    
2.  **[[Out of the Money (OTM)]]**: An option is out of the money when it has no intrinsic value. For call options, this occurs when the market price is below the strike price. For put options, this occurs when the market price is above the strike price.
    
3.  **[[At the Money (ATM)]]**: An option is at the money when the market price of the underlying asset is equal to the strike price. At the money options have no intrinsic value but may still have time value.
