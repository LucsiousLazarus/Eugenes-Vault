## Overview

Capital markets are financial markets where businesses and governments raise long-term funds by issuing debt and equity securities. They facilitate the flow of capital from investors to entities seeking funds for various purposes, such as business expansion or financing infrastructure projects. Capital markets play a crucial role in the efficient allocation of resources and help drive economic growth.

## Types of Capital Markets

Capital markets can be broadly divided into two categories:

1.  **Primary Market**: The primary market is where new securities are issued and sold directly to investors. Companies and governments issue securities, such as stocks and bonds, to raise capital. Investment banks often play a key role in underwriting and marketing these new securities.
    
2.  **Secondary Market**: The secondary market is where investors buy and sell previously issued securities among themselves. Stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ, facilitate trading in the secondary market. The secondary market provides liquidity to investors, allowing them to easily buy and sell securities.
    

## Key Instruments Traded in Capital Markets

1.  **Equity Securities**: Equity securities represent ownership in a company. The most common form of equity security is the common stock, which gives shareholders voting rights and a claim on a company's profits. Dividends, if declared, are paid to shareholders as a portion of a company's profits.
    
2.  **Debt Securities**: Debt securities represent a loan made by an investor to a borrower, typically a company or government. Bonds and debentures are common types of debt securities. The issuer pays periodic interest to the bondholders and repays the principal amount at maturity.
    
3.  **Derivatives**: Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the value of an underlying asset, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, or currencies. Options and futures contracts are common types of derivatives. Derivatives can be used for hedging, speculation, or arbitrage purposes.
    

## Role of Capital Markets

Capital markets serve several important functions in the economy:

1.  **Resource Allocation**: Capital markets help allocate resources efficiently by directing funds from savers to entities that require capital for productive purposes.
    
2.  **Price Discovery**: Capital markets facilitate the determination of the fair value of financial instruments through the interaction of buyers and sellers.
    
3.  **Risk Management**: Capital markets provide opportunities for investors to diversify their portfolios and manage risk through various financial instruments.
    
4.  **Liquidity**: Capital markets provide liquidity to investors by enabling them to buy and sell financial instruments easily.
    
5.  **Economic Growth**: By facilitating the flow of capital, capital markets contribute to economic growth and job creation.
