## Overview

Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) refers to the funds used by a company to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets. This could include property, plant, equipment, technology, or other durable goods.

## Components of CAPEX

CAPEX generally covers two types of expenditure:

1. **Maintenance CAPEX:** This refers to the spending on existing fixed assets to keep the company running smoothly. This could include repairs, upgrades, and similar costs.
2. **Growth CAPEX:** This involves spending on the purchase of new assets with the goal of growing the business. This could include purchasing new equipment, buildings, or land, or investing in long-term projects to increase productivity or capacity.

## CAPEX in Financial Statements

CAPEX is not explicitly listed on the income statement. It is, however, important to the cash flow statement and the balance sheet. On the cash flow statement, CAPEX is a cash outflow under investing activities. On the balance sheet, CAPEX increases the asset base.

## CAPEX vs. OPEX

CAPEX should not be confused with Operating Expenditure (OPEX). While CAPEX refers to long-term investments in assets, OPEX refers to the day-to-day costs of running a business, such as salaries, rent, utilities, and direct production costs. Unlike OPEX, CAPEX is capitalized, meaning it is recorded as an asset and gradually depreciated over its useful life.

## Significance of CAPEX

Understanding a company's CAPEX is vital for investors as it provides insight into a company's growth strategies. High CAPEX might suggest a company is investing in its future growth, while low CAPEX might indicate a company is not investing enough in maintaining or expanding its asset base.
