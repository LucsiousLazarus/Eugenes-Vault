## Overview

The [[Volatility Index]] (VIX) is a real-time market index that represents the market's expectation of 30-day forward-looking volatility. It is calculated by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and derived from the price inputs of the S&P 500 index options.

## What Does VIX Measure?

VIX measures market risk, fear, and stress before significant market events. It is often referred to as the 'fear gauge' or 'fear index'. Investors, research analysts and portfolio managers look to VIX values as a way to measure market risk, fear and stress before they take investment decisions.

## Calculation of VIX

The VIX Index calculation aims to measure the market’s expectation of future volatility. The VIX Index is based on real-time prices of options on the S&P 500® Index (SPX) and is designed to reflect investors' consensus view of future (30-day) expected stock market volatility.

## How to Use VIX?

- **Indicator of Market Volatility**: A high VIX reading marks periods of higher stock market volatility, while low readings mark periods of lower volatility. Generally, VIX starts to rise during periods of financial stress and lessens as investors become complacent.
- **Hedge Against Market Downturn**: Some investors use VIX futures and options as a hedge against market downturns.
- **Contrarian Indicator**: Some traders use the VIX as a contrarian indicator to help them decide when to enter and exit the market.

## VIX Derivatives

CBOE offers VIX futures and VIX options, both of which are the most frequently traded contracts in the volatility space.

## Criticisms of VIX

- VIX may not always be a perfect reflection of underlying market volatility.
- During periods of financial stress, VIX derivatives can become quite expensive, which can make hedging strategies costly.
- While VIX is a widely accepted measure of volatility, it should be used in conjunction with other indicators for market prediction.
