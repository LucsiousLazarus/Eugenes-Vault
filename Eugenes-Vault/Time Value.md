## Overview

Time value is a fundamental concept in finance and economics that refers to the principle that money available today is worth more than the same amount of money available in the future. This is because money today can be invested, generating returns over time, whereas money in the future cannot be used until it is received.

## Key Concepts

1.  **[[Time Value of Money (TVM)]]**: The time value of money is a financial principle that establishes the relationship between the present value of money and its future value.
2.  **[[Present Value (PV)]]**: Present value is the current value of a future cash flow, discounted to reflect the time value of money.
3.  **[[Future Value (FV)]]**: Future value is the value of a cash flow or investment at a specified point in the future, taking into account the time value of money.
4.  **[[Discounting]]**: Discounting is the process of calculating the present value of a future cash flow by applying a discount rate, which reflects the time value of money.
5.  **[[Compounding]]**: Compounding is the process of calculating the future value of a cash flow or investment by applying an interest rate or return over time.

## Time Value of Money in Investing and Finance

Understanding the time value of money is essential in various aspects of finance and investing, including:

1.  **Valuation**: Time value plays a crucial role in the valuation of assets and investments, as it helps determine the present value of future cash flows.
2.  **Capital Budgeting**: Time value is a critical factor in capital budgeting decisions, as it enables businesses to evaluate the potential profitability of investments by comparing the present value of expected future cash flows with the cost of the investment.
3.  **Retirement Planning**: Time value is an essential factor in retirement planning, as it influences the amount of savings and investments required to achieve a specific financial goal in the future.
4.  **Loan and Mortgage Calculations**: Time value is used to calculate the interest and principal payments of loans and mortgages, as well as to determine the present value of the outstanding balance.

## Factors Affecting Time Value

1.  **Interest Rates**: Higher interest rates generally lead to a higher time value of money, as money invested today can potentially generate higher returns in the future.
2.  **Inflation**: Inflation erodes the purchasing power of money over time, making future cash flows less valuable in real terms. As a result, the time value of money increases as inflation rises.
3.  **Risk**: The time value of money is influenced by the risk associated with an investment or cash flow. Higher risk investments generally have a higher time value, as investors demand a higher return to compensate for the increased risk.
