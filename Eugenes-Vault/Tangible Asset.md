## Overview

A [[Tangible Asset]] is a type of asset that has a physical form. It is something that can be touched, seen, and quantified. Tangible assets include both fixed assets, such as machinery, buildings and land, and current assets, such as inventory. These assets play a crucial role in a company's operations and overall financial health.

## Types of Tangible Assets

### Fixed Assets

Fixed assets, also known as long-term assets, plant, property, and equipment (PP&E), are assets that are used in the production of goods or services, or for the company's administrative purposes. They are not expected to be consumed or converted into cash within a year. They include assets like buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, and land. The cost of these assets is spread over their useful life through [[Depreciation Method|depreciation]].

### Current Assets

Current assets are assets that are expected to be consumed, sold, or converted into cash within one year or within the business's normal operating cycle, whichever is longer. They include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and other short-term assets.

## Valuation

Tangible assets are usually recorded on the balance sheet at their original cost. Over time, these assets depreciate, decreasing in value due to wear and tear or obsolescence. This depreciation is recorded as an expense on the income statement and reduces the carrying value of the asset on the balance sheet.

## Role in Financial Analysis

Tangible assets are critical to financial analysis. They can be used as collateral for loans, sold to raise cash, and are often a major factor in the company's production capacity and sales potential. The ratio of tangible assets to total assets is an important indicator of financial leverage and capital structure.
