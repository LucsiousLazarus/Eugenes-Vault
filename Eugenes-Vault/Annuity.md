## Overview

An annuity is a [[Financial Product]] that provides a series of periodic payments over a specified period of time. Annuities are typically used as a long-term [[Investment Vehicle]] for retirement planning, as they can provide a stable and predictable source of income during the retirement years. Annuities are issued by insurance companies and can be structured in various ways to meet the needs and preferences of the annuitant (the person receiving the annuity payments).

## Types of Annuities

1.  **Fixed Annuity**: A fixed annuity provides a guaranteed, fixed interest rate on the investment, and the annuity payments remain constant throughout the term of the annuity contract. This type of annuity is suitable for conservative investors seeking predictability and stability.
    
2.  **Variable Annuity**: A variable annuity allows the annuitant to invest in a variety of investment options, such as [[Stock]]s, [[Bond]]s, or [[Mutual Fund]]s, with the potential for higher returns. The annuity payments may vary based on the performance of the underlying investments, introducing an element of [[Risk]] and [[Uncertainty]].
    
3.  **Indexed Annuity**: An indexed annuity is a hybrid product that combines elements of both fixed and variable annuities. The annuity payments are linked to the performance of a market index, such as the S&P 500, but typically have a guaranteed minimum return to limit downside risk.
    

## Annuity Phases

1.  **Accumulation Phase**: During the accumulation phase, the annuitant makes contributions to the annuity, either as a lump-sum payment or through a series of periodic payments. The contributions are invested according to the chosen annuity type, and the account value grows tax-deferred over time.
    
2.  **Distribution Phase**: The distribution phase begins when the annuitant starts receiving annuity payments. The frequency and amount of the payments depend on the annuity contract and may be fixed, variable, or indexed. Payments can be scheduled to last for a specified period or for the lifetime of the annuitant.
    

## Annuity Payout Options

1.  **Immediate Annuity**: An immediate annuity begins making payments to the annuitant shortly after the initial investment is made, typically within one year. This type of annuity is suitable for those who require an immediate source of income, such as retirees.
    
2.  **Deferred Annuity**: A deferred annuity allows the annuitant to delay the start of annuity payments until a future date, allowing the investment to grow tax-deferred during the accumulation phase. Deferred annuities can be converted into immediate annuities at the start of the distribution phase.
    
3.  **Period Certain Annuity**: This type of annuity guarantees payments for a specified period, such as 10, 15, or 20 years. If the annuitant dies before the end of the period, the remaining payments may be paid to a designated beneficiary.
    
4.  **Life Annuity**: A life annuity provides payments for the lifetime of the annuitant, regardless of how long they live. This type of annuity can help mitigate the risk of outliving one's retirement savings.
