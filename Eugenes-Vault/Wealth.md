## Overview

Wealth is a measure of the value of an individual's or entity's financial and non-financial assets, minus their liabilities. It represents the accumulation of resources and can be used to generate income, maintain or improve living standards, or to be passed on to future generations. Understanding and managing wealth is an important aspect of personal finance and economics.

## Components of Wealth

1.  **[[Asset]]s**: Items of value owned by an individual or entity. Assets can be both tangible (e.g., real estate, vehicles, jewelry) and intangible (e.g., stocks, bonds, patents).
    
2.  **[[Liabilities]]**: Debts or obligations owed to others, such as mortgages, student loans, and credit card balances.
    
3.  **[[Net Worth]]**: The difference between an individual's or entity's assets and liabilities, representing their overall wealth.
    

## Sources of Wealth

1.  **Income**: Earnings from employment, business activities, investments, or other sources. Income can be used to acquire assets, reduce liabilities, or increase savings.
    
2.  **Savings**: The portion of income not spent on consumption or taxes. Savings can be invested to generate additional wealth over time.
    
3.  **Capital Gains**: Increases in the value of assets, such as stocks, real estate, or collectibles. Realized capital gains (from selling assets) can contribute to an individual's wealth.
    
4.  **Inheritance**: Wealth transferred from one generation to another, typically in the form of bequests or gifts.
    
5.  **Windfalls**: Unexpected financial gains, such as lottery winnings or legal settlements.
    

## Wealth Inequality

Wealth inequality refers to the unequal distribution of wealth within a population. It is often measured using the [[Gini Coefficient]], which ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (maximum inequality). Factors contributing to wealth inequality include:

1.  Differences in income and savings rates
2.  Inheritance and intergenerational wealth transfers
3.  Access to financial markets and investment opportunities
4.  Tax policies and government redistribution programs

Wealth inequality can have significant economic and social implications, including reduced social mobility, increased political instability, and lower overall economic growth.

## Wealth Management

Wealth management is the process of managing and growing an individual's or entity's financial resources to achieve their short-term and long-term financial goals. Key components of wealth management include:

1.  **[[Budgeting]]**: Developing a plan to allocate income and savings to meet expenses, reduce debt, and increase wealth.
    
2.  **[[Investing]]**: Allocating resources to various asset classes (e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate) to generate returns and grow wealth over time.
    
3.  **[[Risk Management]]**: Identifying and mitigating potential financial risks, such as market downturns, inflation, and interest rate fluctuations.
    
4.  **[[Tax Planning]]**: Minimizing tax liabilities through strategic investment decisions and tax-advantaged accounts.
    
5.  **[[Estate Planning]]**: Ensuring the orderly transfer of assets to beneficiaries and minimizing potential estate taxes.
