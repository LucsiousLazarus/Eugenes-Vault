## Overview

Fiat Currency is a type of currency issued by a government that is not backed by a physical commodity, like gold or silver. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand and the stability of the issuing government, rather than the value of a commodity backing it.

## Characteristics of Fiat Currency

1. **No Intrinsic Value:** Fiat currency does not have intrinsic value. Its value comes from the trust and confidence people have in the government issuing the currency.
    
2. **Government Issued:** It is issued by a government, and it has declared this particular currency to be legal tender, which means it must be accepted as a form of payment within the country.
    
3. **Not Backed by Physical Commodity:** Unlike commodity money, which is backed by a physical good such as gold or silver, fiat money is not.
    
4. **Supply Control:** Central banks control the supply of fiat currency. They can print more money or withdraw some from circulation to manage the economy.
    

## Advantages of Fiat Currency

1. **Flexibility:** Governments have flexibility in adjusting the money supply based on the needs of the economy.
    
2. **Stability:** Fiat currencies are less prone to shocks that can affect commodities like gold and silver.
    
3. **Control over Inflation:** Central banks can use monetary policy to control inflation by manipulating interest rates and controlling the money supply.
    

## Disadvantages of Fiat Currency

1. **Inflation Risk:** If too much fiat money is printed, it can lead to hyperinflation.
    
2. **Dependence on Government and Economy:** The value of fiat money is highly dependent on the stability of the government and economy.
    
3. **No Tangible Collateral:** Since fiat money is not backed by a physical commodity, its value can potentially become zero in the event of severe economic or political crisis.
