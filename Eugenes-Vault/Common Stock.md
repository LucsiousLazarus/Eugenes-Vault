## Overview

Common stock represents shares of ownership in a corporation, providing a claim on part of the company's assets and earnings. There are two main types of stock: common and preferred. The difference being that common stock usually carries voting rights that enable the shareholder to have a say in corporate meetings (like the annual general meeting or AGM) where matters such as election to the board of directors or appointment of auditors are voted upon.

## Key Concepts

1. **Dividends:** Common shareholders may receive a portion of the company's profits in the form of dividends, which are typically paid out quarterly. The board of directors decides the amount of dividends.
    
2. **Voting Rights:** Common shareholders typically have the right to vote on certain matters relating to the company. This usually includes voting for the board of directors and on major corporate policy decisions.
    
3. **Capital Appreciation:** Common stockholders can profit from capital appreciation if the market price of the stock rises over time. This can occur due to overall market conditions, company performance, or other factors.
    
4. **Risk and Return:** Common stock is considered riskier than preferred stock and debt instruments as they are the last to claim any assets if the company goes bankrupt. However, they also offer higher potential returns.
    

## Types of Common Stock

1. **Blue-Chip Stocks:** These are shares in large, well-established and financially sound companies with a history of reliable performance.
    
2. **Growth Stocks:** These are shares in companies that are expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to other companies in the market.
    
3. **Income Stocks:** These are shares in companies that pay regular, high dividends relative to their stock price.
    
4. **Value Stocks:** These are shares in companies that are considered undervalued compared to their intrinsic value.
    

## Role in the Financial System

Common stocks play a crucial role in the financial system. They provide companies with capital that they need to grow and expand. For investors, common stocks offer a way to participate in a company's success through capital appreciation and dividends.
