## Overview

[[Beta]] is a measure of the systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. It is used in the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which calculates the expected return of an asset based on its beta and expected market returns.

## Calculation of Beta

Beta is calculated using regression analysis, and you can think of it as the tendency of a security's returns to respond to swings in the market. A beta of 1 indicates that the security's price will move with the market. A beta less than 1 means that the security will be less volatile than the market. A beta greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.

## Applications of Beta

- **Investment Decision**: Investors can consider beta when deciding if a security fits the risk vs reward profile they are targeting.
- **Risk Measurement**: Beta is a key component in the [[Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)]], which is used to calculate the theoretically required return of an investment given its level of risk.
- **Portfolio Management**: Beta can be used to manage risk and construct a portfolio that meets the investor's risk/return requirements.

## The Limitations of Beta

- Beta is a historical measure and may not predict future risk.
- The market used as a benchmark in beta calculations can greatly influence the beta value.
- Beta assumes that investment risk is adequately captured by the variance of returns, but some investments may exhibit characteristics that are not well described by this measure.
