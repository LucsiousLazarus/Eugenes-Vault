## Overview

A cash flow statement, also known as a statement of cash flows, is a financial statement that summarizes a company's cash inflows and outflows during a specific period, typically a fiscal quarter or year. It provides insight into a company's ability to generate cash, meet financial obligations, and fund its operations and investments. The cash flow statement is one of the three main financial statements, along with the balance sheet and income statement.

The cash flow statement is divided into three main sections: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.

## Operating Activities

Operating activities include cash flows related to a company's core business operations, such as:

-   Cash received from customers
-   Cash paid to suppliers and employees
-   Interest received and paid
-   Taxes paid

The operating activities section starts with net income from the income statement and then adjusts for non-cash items and changes in working capital, such as depreciation, accounts receivable, and inventory.

## Investing Activities

Investing activities include cash flows related to a company's investments in long-term assets, such as:

-   Purchases and sales of property, plant, and equipment (PPE)
-   Acquisitions and disposals of businesses or subsidiaries
-   Purchases and sales of securities, excluding cash equivalents

These activities generally involve the expansion or reduction of a company's productive capacity and investment portfolio.

## Financing Activities

Financing activities include cash flows related to a company's funding sources and the return of capital to investors, such as:

-   Issuance and repayment of debt
-   Issuance and repurchase of shares
-   Payment of dividends

These activities reflect how a company raises capital and returns value to its shareholders.

## Importance of the Cash Flow Statement

The cash flow statement is a critical tool for evaluating a company's financial health and performance, as it provides information about a company's ability to generate cash and meet its financial obligations. It can help investors, creditors, and other stakeholders:

-   Assess a company's liquidity and solvency
-   Evaluate a company's cash-generating capacity
-   Determine the quality of a company's earnings
-   Identify trends and potential risks related to cash flow

## Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow (FCF) is a key metric derived from the cash flow statement that represents the cash generated by a company's operations after accounting for capital expenditures (i.e., investments in PPE). FCF is an important indicator of a company's financial flexibility, as it measures the cash available for expansion, debt repayment, dividend payments, and other discretionary uses.

FCF can be calculated using the following formula:

Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures
