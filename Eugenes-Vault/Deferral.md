## Overview

Deferral, in the context of finance and accounting, refers to the process of postponing the recognition of certain revenues or expenses on financial statements. Deferrals are commonly used in accrual accounting to match revenues and expenses with the periods in which they are earned or incurred, respectively. This practice provides a more accurate picture of a company's financial performance and health.

There are two main types of deferrals: deferred revenues and deferred expenses.

## Deferred Revenues

Deferred revenues, also known as unearned revenues, represent cash received by a company for goods or services that have not yet been delivered or rendered. This revenue is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet until the goods or services are provided, at which point the revenue is recognized on the income statement.

Examples of deferred revenues include:

-   Advance payments for subscriptions
-   Prepaid service contracts
-   Deposits for future services

## Deferred Expenses

Deferred expenses, also known as prepaid expenses, are costs that have been paid in advance for goods or services that have not yet been consumed or used. These expenses are recorded as assets on the balance sheet until they are used, at which point they are recognized as expenses on the income statement.

Examples of deferred expenses include:

-   Prepaid rent
-   Prepaid insurance premiums
-   Advance payments for professional services

## Impact on [[Financial Statement]]s

Deferrals impact both the balance sheet and the income statement. On the balance sheet, deferred revenues are recorded as liabilities, while deferred expenses are recorded as assets. Over time, as the goods or services are provided, deferred revenues are recognized as revenue on the income statement, and deferred expenses are recognized as expenses.

Proper deferral management is essential for accurate financial reporting, as it ensures that revenues and expenses are recognized in the appropriate accounting periods. This practice helps businesses, investors, and other stakeholders assess a company's financial performance more accurately.
