## Overview

Loan and mortgage calculations are essential for understanding the cost of borrowing money, determining monthly payments, and planning financial goals. Key components of loan and mortgage calculations include the principal amount, interest rate, loan term, and payment frequency.

## Loan Calculation Components

1.  **[[Principal Amount]]**: The amount of money borrowed.
2.  **[[Interest Rate]]**: The percentage charged on the borrowed money, usually expressed as an [[Annual Percentage Rate (APR)]].
3.  **[[Loan Term]]**: The duration of the loan, typically expressed in months or years.
4.  **[[Payment Frequency]]**: How often payments are made (monthly, bi-weekly, etc.).

## [[Amortization Schedule]]

An amortization schedule is a table that shows the breakdown of loan payments over time, including principal and interest amounts. It helps borrowers understand how much of each payment goes towards the principal and how much goes towards interest, as well as the remaining balance at each payment period.

## Monthly Payment Calculation

The formula to calculate the monthly payment for a fixed-rate loan or mortgage is:

P = (r * PV) / (1 - (1 + r)^(-n))

-   P: monthly payment
-   r: monthly interest rate (annual interest rate / 12)
-   PV: present value (loan amount)
-   n: total number of payments (loan term in months)

## Example

Suppose you want to calculate the monthly payment for a $200,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a fixed interest rate of 4% per year. Using the monthly payment calculation formula:

-   r = 0.04 / 12 ≈ 0.003333
-   n = 30 * 12 = 360
-   PV = $200,000

P = (0.003333 * $200,000) / (1 - (1 + 0.003333)^(-360)) P ≈ $954.83

The monthly payment for the [[Mortgage]] would be approximately $954.83.

## Applications

1.  **Borrowing Decisions**: Loan and mortgage calculations can help borrowers make informed decisions by understanding the cost of borrowing and the impact on their monthly budget.
2.  **Loan Comparisons**: Comparing loan offers with different interest rates, terms, and payment structures can help borrowers choose the best option for their needs.
3.  **Financial Planning**: Loan and mortgage calculations can assist in setting financial goals, such as paying off a mortgage early or refinancing to save on interest.
