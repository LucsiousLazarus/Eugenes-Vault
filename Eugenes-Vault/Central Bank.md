## Overview

A central bank is a financial institution responsible for overseeing a country's monetary policy and maintaining the stability of its financial system. Central banks play a crucial role in the economy by controlling the money supply, setting interest rates, and ensuring the stability and soundness of the banking system. In most countries, central banks operate independently of political influence to ensure that their decisions are based solely on economic factors.

## Key Functions of Central Banks

1.  **Monetary Policy**: Central banks implement monetary policy by controlling the money supply and setting interest rates to achieve economic objectives such as low inflation, full employment, and economic growth.
    
2.  **Bank Supervision and Regulation**: Central banks are responsible for supervising and regulating commercial banks and other financial institutions to ensure the stability and soundness of the banking system.
    
3.  **Currency Issuance**: Central banks issue and manage a country's currency, ensuring its stability and integrity.
    
4.  **Lender of Last Resort**: In times of financial crisis, central banks act as the lender of last resort, providing liquidity to the banking system to prevent a collapse.
    
5.  **Foreign Exchange Reserves Management**: Central banks manage a country's foreign exchange reserves, which can be used to influence exchange rates or provide liquidity during a financial crisis.
    
6.  **Economic Research and Analysis**: Central banks conduct economic research and analysis to support their decision-making and provide valuable insights into the economy.

## Monetary Policy Tools

Central banks use various monetary policy tools to control the money supply and influence interest rates, including:

1.  **Open Market Operations**: Central banks buy or sell government securities in the open market to adjust the amount of money circulating in the economy.
    
2.  **Discount Rate**: Central banks set the discount rate, the interest rate charged to commercial banks for borrowing from the central bank, to influence short-term interest rates.
    
3.  **Reserve Requirements**: Central banks set reserve requirements, which determine the amount of cash commercial banks must hold as reserves against their deposits, to control the money supply.
    
4.  **Forward Guidance**: Central banks provide forward guidance on future monetary policy actions to influence market expectations and financial conditions.
    
5.  **Quantitative Easing**: In extraordinary circumstances, central banks may implement quantitative easing, purchasing large quantities of financial assets to inject liquidity into the financial system and lower long-term interest rates.
