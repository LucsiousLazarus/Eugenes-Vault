## Overview

An amortization schedule is a table that provides a detailed breakdown of [[Loan]] or [[Mortgage]] payments over time. It helps borrowers understand how much of each payment goes towards the principal and how much goes towards interest, as well as the remaining balance at each payment period.

## Purpose

The purpose of an amortization schedule is to:

1.  Visualize the allocation of each payment towards principal and interest.
2.  Track the remaining balance of the loan or mortgage at any point in time.
3.  Help borrowers plan their financial goals, such as paying off debt early or refinancing.

## Key Components

1.  **Payment Period**: The specific time interval for each payment (monthly, bi-weekly, etc.).
2.  **Payment Amount**: The total amount paid during each period.
3.  **Interest Paid**: The portion of the payment amount allocated towards interest.
4.  **Principal Paid**: The portion of the payment amount allocated towards the principal.
5.  **Remaining Balance**: The outstanding loan or mortgage balance after each payment.

## Amortization Schedule Calculation

To create an amortization schedule, follow these steps:

1.  Calculate the monthly payment using the loan or mortgage details, including the principal amount, interest rate, and loan term.
2.  For each payment period, determine the interest paid by multiplying the remaining balance by the periodic interest rate.
3.  Calculate the principal paid by subtracting the interest paid from the total payment amount.
4.  Update the remaining balance by subtracting the principal paid from the previous remaining balance.
5.  Repeat these steps for each payment period until the remaining balance reaches zero.

## Example

Suppose you have a $200,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a fixed interest rate of 4% per year. The monthly payment calculated previously was approximately $954.83.

| Payment Period | Payment Amount | Interest Paid | Principal Paid | Remaining Balance |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1              | $954.83        | $666.67       | $288.16        | $199,711.84       |
| 2              | $954.83        | $665.71       | $289.12        | $199,422.72       |
| 3              | $954.83        | $664.74       | $290.09        | $199,132.63       |

## Applications

1.  **Budgeting**: An amortization schedule helps borrowers understand their loan or mortgage payments and allocate funds accordingly.
2.  **Debt Management**: By visualizing the principal and interest allocation, borrowers can identify opportunities to pay off debt early or refinance.
3.  **Financial Planning**: Amortization schedules assist in setting financial goals, such as determining the impact of additional principal payments or evaluating the benefits of refinancing.
