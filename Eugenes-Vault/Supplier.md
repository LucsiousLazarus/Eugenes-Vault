## Overview

A [[Supplier]] is an entity that provides goods or services to another organization. This entity can be an individual, a company, or a country that is part of a larger supply chain. Goods provided by a supplier to a business are often used in the production process to create other goods or services, while services are typically used for operational needs.

## Role in Business Operations

Suppliers play a crucial role in a business’s operations. They are the source of the raw materials, goods, and services that a company needs to operate and produce its own goods or services.

A company's relationship with its suppliers is key to its [[Supply Chain Management (SCM)]] and overall success. Establishing good relationships can lead to cost savings, improved quality, and better service. On the other hand, poor supplier relationships can lead to disruptions in the supply chain, increased costs, and delays in production.

## Payment Terms and Trade Credit

The business arrangement between a buyer and a supplier usually involves certain [[Payment Term|payment terms]]. Suppliers often provide a period of [[Trade Credit]] — this is the credit extended by the supplier to the buyer between the time the goods are delivered and the time the payment is received.

## Inventory Management

Suppliers play a critical role in [[Inventory Management]]. Regular and timely supply of goods ensures smooth production and operational processes, reduces inventory holding costs, and minimizes the risk of stockouts.

## Supplier Selection

Supplier selection is a critical activity within the procurement function of a business. Companies assess suppliers on a variety of parameters such as price, quality, delivery schedule, and capacity. Companies may use various analytical approaches for supplier selection, such as weighted point models, cost-ratio methods, and mathematical programming models.
