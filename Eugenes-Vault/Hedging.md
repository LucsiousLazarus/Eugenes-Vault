## Overview

[[Hedging]] is a risk management strategy used by individuals and corporations to protect against potential losses from fluctuations in prices, rates, or values. This financial strategy involves taking an offsetting position in a related security, such as a [[Futures Contract]] or [[Options]].

## Purpose of Hedging

The main aim of hedging is not necessarily to generate profits but to limit potential losses. Hedging strategies can protect against various risks, including commodity price changes, currency fluctuations, interest rate moves, and equity price swings.

## Hedging Instruments

There are several financial instruments that investors and companies can use to hedge risks:

- **[[Futures Contracts]]**: A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specific time in the future.
    
- **[[Options]]**: Options contracts give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price within a certain time period.
    
- **[[Swap]]s**: Swaps are derivative contracts where two parties exchange financial instruments or cash flows.
    
- **[[Forward Contracts]]**: Forward contracts are non-standardized contracts between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a specified future time at a price agreed upon today.
    

## Types of Hedging

Different types of hedging strategies include:

- **Commodity Hedging**: Companies that rely on certain commodities in their business might hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices.
    
- **Currency Hedging**: Firms with international operations might hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates.
    
- **Interest Rate Hedging**: Investors or companies with exposure to interest-bearing assets or liabilities might hedge against changes in interest rates.
    

## Hedging Costs and Benefits

Hedging strategies can reduce the risk of losses from price fluctuations, but they also come with costs, including transaction costs and the potential opportunity cost of limiting potential profits. As such, companies and investors must balance the trade-offs when deciding whether to hedge and how much coverage to seek.
