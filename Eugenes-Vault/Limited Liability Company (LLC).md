## Overview

A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a flexible and popular type of business entity that combines the advantages of both corporations and partnerships. An LLC provides its owners, called members, with limited liability protection, while also allowing for pass-through taxation and flexible management structures.

## Key Features of an LLC

1.  **Limited Liability**: Members of an LLC are protected from personal liability for the company's debts and obligations. Their personal assets, such as homes, cars, and personal bank accounts, are generally not at risk if the LLC faces financial difficulties or legal issues.
    
2.  **Pass-through Taxation**: Unlike a corporation, an LLC is not subject to double taxation. The profits and losses of the LLC are passed through to the members and reported on their personal tax returns. This allows members to avoid the double taxation that occurs when a corporation pays taxes on its profits and shareholders pay taxes on dividends.
    
3.  **Flexible Management Structure**: LLCs can be managed by their members or by appointed managers. This allows for greater flexibility in the organization's management and decision-making processes.
    
4.  **Fewer Formalities**: Compared to corporations, LLCs have fewer legal and administrative requirements, such as annual shareholder meetings or board of directors meetings. This makes LLCs easier and less expensive to manage and operate.
    

## Formation of an LLC

To form an LLC, the following steps must be taken:

1.  Choose a unique business name that complies with state requirements.
2.  File the Articles of Organization with the appropriate state agency, usually the Secretary of State.
3.  Pay the required filing fees, which vary by state.
4.  Obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) if the LLC has more than one member or if it plans to hire employees.
5.  Create an Operating Agreement that outlines the rules and procedures for managing the LLC, including the roles and responsibilities of its members and managers.
6.  Obtain any required business licenses or permits.
