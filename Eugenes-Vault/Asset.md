## Overview

An asset is an economic resource that holds value and can be owned or controlled by an individual, [[Corporation]], or [[Government]]. Assets are the building blocks of [[Wealth]] and can be tangible (physical) or intangible (non-physical). They are used to generate [[Cash Flow]]s, reduce liabilities, and increase the overall value of an [[Entity]].

## Types of Assets

1.  **[[Tangible Asset]]s**: These are physical assets that can be seen and touched. Examples include:
    
    -   [[Real Estate]] (land, buildings, etc.)
    -   [[Machinery]] and [[Equipment]]
    -   [[Inventory]] and [[Raw Material]]s
    -   Vehicles and transportation equipment
2.  **[[Intangible Asset]]s**: These are non-physical assets that derive value from the rights and ownership they provide. Examples include:
    
    -   Patents, trademarks, and copyrights
    -   Goodwill (the value of a company's reputation)
    -   Software and technology licenses
    -   Brand recognition and customer relationships
