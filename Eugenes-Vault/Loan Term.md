## Overview

The [[Loan Term]] is the predetermined period of time in which a borrower promises to repay the lender the [[Loan Amount|principal]] and interest of a loan.

## Key Aspects of Loan Term

1. **Length:** Loan terms can range from a few months to many years, depending on the type of loan and the lender's policies. For instance, mortgages often have long terms (15, 20, or 30 years), while car loans and personal loans might have shorter terms (3 to 7 years).
    
2. **Repayment Schedule:** The repayment schedule is largely determined by the term of the loan. It can be monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual, depending on the agreement between the borrower and lender.
    
3. **Interest Rate:** Longer loan terms often have higher interest rates because the risk to the lender is higher over a longer period. Conversely, shorter-term loans generally have lower interest rates.
    

## Calculation

The loan term impacts the amount of interest a borrower will pay over the life of the loan. Using a simple interest calculation:

`Total Interest Paid = Principal * Interest Rate * Term`

For compound interest loans, the calculation is more complex and requires a formula that takes into account the compounding period.

## Loan Types

Various loan types with different standard terms include:

- [[Personal Loan]]
- [[Mortgage]]
- [[Auto Loan]]
- [[Student Loan]]
- [[Business Loan]]

## Factors Affecting Loan Term

Several factors can influence the term of a loan:

- **Creditworthiness:** Lenders often offer longer terms to borrowers with strong credit profiles.
- **Loan Amount:** Larger loans often have longer terms to make the monthly repayments more affordable.
- **Lender Policies:** Each lender has its own policies regarding the terms they offer for different loans.
