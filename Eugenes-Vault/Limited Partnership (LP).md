## Overview

A Limited Partnership (LP) is a type of partnership that includes both general partners, who manage the business and are personally liable for its debts, and limited partners, who contribute capital but have limited liability and do not participate in management. The limited partners' liability is generally limited to the amount of their capital contribution. Limited Partnerships are often used for investments, real estate, and other ventures where it is advantageous to have a mix of active and passive participants.

## Key Characteristics

1.  **Formation**: A Limited Partnership is typically formed by filing a Certificate of Limited Partnership with the appropriate state agency. A written partnership agreement should also be created, outlining the roles, responsibilities, and financial contributions of both general and limited partners.
    
2.  **Ownership and Management**: In a Limited Partnership, management is the responsibility of the general partners, while limited partners are passive investors who do not participate in the day-to-day operations of the business. This structure allows limited partners to invest in the partnership without taking on significant management responsibilities or liability.
    
3.  **Taxation**: A Limited Partnership is not a separate tax entity, which means that profits and losses are "passed through" to the partners and taxed at their individual tax rates. This can be advantageous for some business owners, as it avoids the double taxation that can occur with corporations.
    
4.  **Liability**: General partners in a Limited Partnership are personally responsible for the partnership's debts and obligations, while limited partners have limited liability. The liability of limited partners is generally limited to the amount of their capital contribution, protecting their personal assets from the partnership's debts and obligations.

## Dissolution
