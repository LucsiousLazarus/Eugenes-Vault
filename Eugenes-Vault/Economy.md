## Overview

The economy refers to all the activities related to the production, consumption, and trade of goods and services in an area. It includes all economic agents (individuals, businesses, and government) and their interactions. These activities are governed by the laws of supply and demand, which determine the prices of goods and services.

## Components of an Economy

1. **Households:** These are individuals and families that consume goods and services. They supply labor to businesses and receive wages in return.
    
2. **Businesses:** These are entities that produce goods and services. They employ labor, land, and capital to generate profits.
    
3. **Government:** The government plays a significant role in the economy. It provides public goods and services, enforces laws and regulations, and may intervene in the economy to correct market failures or to achieve social goals.
    
4. **Financial Institutions:** These include banks, insurance companies, and other entities that facilitate the flow of funds from savers and investors to individuals, businesses, and government that need funds.
    
5. **Foreign Sector:** This consists of foreign buyers and sellers of goods, services, and financial assets.
    

## Economic Systems

There are primarily three types of economic systems:

1. **Market Economy:** In a market economy, decisions regarding investment, production, and distribution are based on the interplay of supply and demand. Prices of goods and services are determined in a free price system.
    
2. **Planned Economy:** In a planned or command economy, the government or a central authority makes all decisions regarding the production and distribution of goods and services.
    
3. **Mixed Economy:** A mixed economy combines elements of market and planned economies. The government plays a role in regulating certain industries, but other sectors are left to private businesses.
    

## Measuring the Economy

Key measures of economic activity include:

1. **Gross Domestic Product (GDP):** The total value of all goods and services produced within a country in a given period. It's a broad measure of a nation's overall economic activity.
    
2. **Unemployment Rate:** The percentage of the labor force that is jobless and actively seeking employment.
    
3. **Inflation Rate:** The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising.
