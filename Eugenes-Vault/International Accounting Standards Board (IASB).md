## Overview

The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is an independent, non-profit organization that develops and promotes a single set of global accounting standards, known as the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The IASB's mission is to bring transparency, accountability, and efficiency to financial markets worldwide by fostering a common understanding of financial information across different countries and regions.

## History and Formation

The IASB was established in 2001 to replace the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC), which was founded in 1973. The IASC had been developing International Accounting Standards (IAS) since its inception, but the need for a more structured and effective organization led to the formation of the IASB.

## Structure and Governance

The IASB operates under the oversight of the IFRS Foundation, which is responsible for ensuring the organization's independence, accountability, and public interest focus. The IASB consists of 14 board members, including a chair and a vice-chair, who are appointed based on their professional competence and practical experience in accounting, finance, and related fields. Board members represent various geographical regions and backgrounds, ensuring diversity and inclusiveness in standard-setting.

## IFRS and the Standard-Setting Process

The IASB's primary responsibility is to develop and maintain the IFRS, a set of high-quality, global accounting standards designed to provide a consistent and comparable basis for financial reporting. The IFRS aims to make it easier for investors, regulators, and other stakeholders to understand and compare financial information across different countries and regions.

The IASB follows a rigorous, transparent, and consultative standard-setting process that involves the following steps:

1.  Identifying and assessing the need for a new standard or amendment
2.  Developing and publishing a discussion paper for public comment
3.  Reviewing feedback and developing an exposure draft
4.  Seeking public comments on the exposure draft
5.  Finalizing and issuing the new standard or amendment
6.  Monitoring the implementation of the new standard and providing guidance as needed

## Relationship with National Accounting Standards

While the IASB promotes the adoption of IFRS worldwide, some countries continue to use their national accounting standards, such as the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the United States. In recent years, efforts have been made to converge national accounting standards with IFRS to enhance the comparability of financial information and facilitate cross-border investments. However, full convergence has not yet been achieved, and differences between IFRS and national accounting standards still exist.
