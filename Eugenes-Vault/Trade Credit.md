## Overview

[[Trade Credit]] is a type of commercial financing where a supplier allows the customer to purchase goods or services on account, meaning the customer can defer payment until a later date. The term "trade" refers to the transaction between the two parties, and "credit" refers to the allowance to pay at a later date.

## Key Components of Trade Credit

1. **Credit Period**: This is the length of time that the customer has to pay the supplier. It varies from industry to industry and can range from a few days to a few months.
    
2. **Discount for Early Payment**: To incentivize early payment, suppliers often offer a discount if the customer pays within a specified shorter period.
    
3. **Late Payment Penalties**: If the customer doesn't pay within the agreed credit period, they may incur penalties such as late fees or interest charges.
    

## Advantages of Trade Credit

1. **Improved Cash Flow for Buyers**: Trade credit can improve a buyer's cash flow by allowing them to delay payment for goods and services.
    
2. **Potential for Sales Growth for Suppliers**: By offering trade credit, suppliers can potentially attract more customers and increase sales.
    
3. **Building Business Relationships**: Trade credit can help build strong business relationships between suppliers and customers.
    

## Disadvantages and Risks of Trade Credit

1. **Risk of Non-Payment**: There's always a risk that the customer will not pay, either due to cash flow problems or bankruptcy.
    
2. **Ties up Working Capital for Suppliers**: Suppliers may have a significant amount of money tied up in accounts receivable.
    

## Trade Credit Management

Effective management of trade credit involves careful assessment of the creditworthiness of customers, monitoring of accounts receivable, and prompt action in case of late payments.
