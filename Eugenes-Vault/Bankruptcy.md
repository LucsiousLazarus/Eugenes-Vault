## Overview

Bankruptcy is a legal process that occurs when an individual or business is unable to repay its outstanding debts. It offers a way for debtors to restructure or eliminate their debts and provides creditors with an opportunity to recover a portion of the outstanding debt. Bankruptcy is governed by federal law, and bankruptcy cases are filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court.

## Types of Bankruptcy

1.  **Chapter 7 (Liquidation)**: Chapter 7 bankruptcy, also known as liquidation bankruptcy, is the most common form of bankruptcy for individuals. Under Chapter 7, the debtor's non-exempt assets are sold by a court-appointed trustee, and the proceeds are used to repay creditors. After the liquidation process, most of the debtor's unsecured debts are discharged, providing them with a fresh financial start.
    
2.  **Chapter 11 (Reorganization)**: Chapter 11 bankruptcy is primarily used by businesses that need to restructure their debts and operations to regain profitability. Under Chapter 11, the debtor proposes a reorganization plan to the court, which outlines how the business will repay its creditors over time while continuing to operate. Creditors and the court must approve the reorganization plan, and the debtor must adhere to the plan's terms.
    
3.  **Chapter 13 (Individual Debt Adjustment)**: Chapter 13 bankruptcy is designed for individuals with a regular income who want to repay their debts but need more time or a modified repayment plan. Under Chapter 13, the debtor proposes a repayment plan to the court, which typically lasts three to five years. During this time, the debtor makes payments to a court-appointed trustee, who distributes the funds to creditors. Upon successful completion of the repayment plan, the debtor's remaining eligible debts are discharged.
    

## Consequences of Bankruptcy

While bankruptcy can provide relief from overwhelming debt, it also has significant consequences that should be carefully considered before filing:

1.  **Credit Score Impact**: Bankruptcy has a negative impact on the debtor's credit score, making it more difficult to obtain credit, loans, or mortgages in the future. Chapter 7 bankruptcy remains on an individual's credit report for ten years, while Chapter 13 bankruptcy remains for seven years.
    
2.  **Loss of Assets**: In Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the debtor may lose non-exempt assets during the liquidation process. In Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the debtor may need to surrender assets if they cannot meet the terms of the repayment plan.
    
3.  **Stigma**: Bankruptcy carries a social stigma that may affect the debtor's personal and professional relationships.
    
4.  **Employment and Housing**: Some employers or landlords may consider bankruptcy when making hiring or renting decisions, which could limit the debtor's options.
    
5.  **Ineligibility for Certain Debts**: Not all debts can be discharged in bankruptcy, including student loans, alimony, child support, and some tax debts.
