## Overview

[[Present Value (PV)]] is the concept in finance that money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future, due to its potential earning capacity. This concept, which is a fundamental component of the [[Time Value of Money]], is used to compare the value of money received in the future with the value of money in hand today.

## Calculation of Present Value

The Present Value is calculated using the following formula:

PV = FV / (1 + r)^n

where:

- FV is the future value of the money,
- r is the [[Discount Rate]], and
- n is the number of periods.

## Application in Investment Analysis

Present Value is an integral part of [[Investment Analysis]] and is commonly used in:

1. **Net Present Value (NPV):** In capital budgeting, net present value measures the profitability of a project by comparing the present value of cash inflows with the present value of cash outflows. If NPV is positive, the project is considered profitable.
    
2. **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF):** DCF analysis uses the concept of present value to value an investment, company, or asset based on the idea that money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future.
    
3. **Bond Pricing:** The price of a bond is the sum of the present values of its future cash flows (coupon payments and principal repayment).
    
4. **Pension Funds and Insurance:** Present value is used to determine the amount of cash that must be invested currently to fulfill a future liability.
