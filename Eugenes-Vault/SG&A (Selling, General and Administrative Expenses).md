## Overview

SG&A, or Selling, General and Administrative expenses, is a category of expenses in an income statement that includes all non-production costs. These are the costs not directly tied to making a product or performing a service.

## Composition of SG&A

### Selling Expenses

Selling expenses are costs associated with the distribution and sale of a companyâ€™s goods or services. These might include:

- [[Sales Commission]]
- Advertising and promotional materials
- Depreciation of sales store buildings and equipment
- Delivery expenses

### General and Administrative Expenses

General and Administrative (G&A) expenses are the overhead costs of running the business and include:

- Office salaries
- Office supplies
- Utilities
- Depreciation of office equipment and building
- Legal and professional fees
- Insurance

## Significance of SG&A

SG&A is a significant measure because it's an indicator of how efficiently the management operates a business. A relatively high SG&A expense can suggest a company is not managing its costs well, whereas a relatively low SG&A expense can suggest high efficiency. However, this does not always hold true as a company might strategically choose to spend more on areas like advertising to gain market share.

Monitoring SG&A over time and comparing it to peers in the industry can give investors and management a better idea of company performance and efficiency.
