## Overview

An [[Intangible Asset]] is a type of asset that is not physical in nature. They are assets owned by a company that are not physical items, such as buildings or machinery, but still have value due to the advantages or exclusive rights they provide to the business.

## Characteristics of Intangible Assets

Intangible assets share the following characteristics:

1. They lack a physical presence: Unlike [[Tangible Assets]], intangible assets cannot be touched.
2. They generate value: Like all assets, intangible assets add value to the company.
3. They are identifiable: Intangible assets can be separated from the company and sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged.

## Examples of Intangible Assets

Common examples of intangible assets include:

- [[Goodwill]]
- Brand recognition
- Intellectual property (patents, copyrights, trademarks)
- [[Copyright]]
- Trade secrets (formulas, practices, processes)
- Licenses

## Accounting for Intangible Assets

Intangible assets are reported on the balance sheet. They are often amortized over their useful life. Unlike a [[Tangible Asset]], intangible assets are not depreciated. If an intangible asset has an indefinite life, such as goodwill, it is not amortized.

## Impairment of Intangible Assets

If the value of an intangible asset declines, an impairment loss is recognized. This happens when the carrying amount of the asset is greater than the sum of the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges).
