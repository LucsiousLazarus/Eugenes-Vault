## Overview

[[Equipment]] is a category of [[Tangible Asset]]s that companies utilize to produce goods or deliver services. Examples include machinery, vehicles, office devices, and IT hardware. Unlike intangible assets, equipment has a physical presence and is often essential for day-to-day operations.

## Role in Business

Equipment plays a critical role in business operations. Its importance can be categorized into the following:

1. **Production**: Many industries, like manufacturing, agriculture, and mining, heavily depend on machinery and equipment to produce goods.
    
2. **Efficiency**: Equipment can enhance the efficiency of operations, leading to cost savings, quicker service delivery, and increased output.
    
3. **Quality**: Advanced equipment can improve the quality of products or services, thus enhancing a company's competitive advantage.
    

## Accounting for Equipment

In financial accounting, equipment is usually considered a long-term asset, often referred to as property, plant, and equipment (PP&E).

- **Acquisition**: When a company acquires equipment, the cost is capitalized, meaning it's recorded as an asset rather than an immediate expense.
    
- **Depreciation**: Over time, the value of the equipment decreases due to wear and tear and technological obsolescence. This decrease in value is accounted for as [[Depreciation]] expense, gradually reducing the asset's book value over its useful life.
    
- **Disposal**: When the equipment is sold or scrapped, the company records a gain or loss based on the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the equipment's book value at the time of disposal.
    

## Equipment Financing

Companies can purchase equipment outright, lease it, or obtain it through equipment financing, a type of loan specifically for purchasing business-related equipment. Each option has its benefits and trade-offs related to costs, risks, and control.
