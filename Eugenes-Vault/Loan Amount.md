## Overview

The [[Loan Amount]] is the initial sum of money borrowed in a loan. It is also commonly referred to as the principal amount.

## Key Aspects of Loan Amount

1. **Principal:** This is the total amount initially borrowed in a loan. The principal amount does not include interest or any other fees that may be associated with the loan.
    
2. **Interest:** The interest on a loan is calculated as a percentage of the principal. It represents the cost of borrowing the loan amount and is paid in addition to repaying the principal.
    
3. **Loan Term:** This is the duration of time over which the loan is to be repaid. The loan term can affect the amount of interest paid over the life of the loan.
    

## Calculation

The total cost of a loan over its term can be calculated as the loan amount plus the total interest paid. The formula is:

`Total Cost = Loan Amount + (Loan Amount * Interest Rate * Loan Term)`

This equation assumes simple interest. For loans with compound interest, the calculation would be more complex.

## Factors Influencing Loan Amount

The loan amount a person or entity can borrow typically depends on their creditworthiness, which is determined by factors like credit score, income, and ability to repay the loan.

## Loan Types

Different types of loans include:

- [[Personal Loan]]
- [[Mortgage]]
- [[Auto Loan]]
- [[Student Loan]]
- [[Business Loan]]

Each of these loan types can have varying factors that influence the loan amount, interest rates, and repayment terms.
