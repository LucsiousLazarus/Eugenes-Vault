## Overview

A dividend is a payment made by a [[Corporation]] to its [[Shareholder]]s, typically in the form of [[Cash]] or additional [[Share]]s. Dividends are usually paid out of a [[Company]]'s [[Profit]]s as a way to distribute a portion of the earnings back to the shareholders. Dividends provide shareholders with a source of [[Income]] and can be an important consideration for [[Investor]]s when evaluating a company's [[Stock]].

## Key Concepts

### 1. [[Dividend Yield]]

-   The dividend yield is a [[Financial Ratio]] that shows the annual dividend income per share relative to the market price per share.
-   It is calculated by dividing the annual dividends per share by the market price per share and is expressed as a percentage.
-   A higher dividend yield indicates a more attractive investment from an income perspective.

### 2. [[Dividend Payout Ratio]]

-   The dividend payout ratio is a financial ratio that measures the proportion of earnings a company pays its shareholders in the form of dividends.
-   It is calculated by dividing the dividends per share by the earnings per share.
-   A lower payout ratio indicates that a company retains a larger portion of its earnings for reinvestment, while a higher payout ratio indicates a larger proportion of earnings being distributed to shareholders.

### 3. [[Dividend Policy]]

-   A company's dividend policy determines how much of its earnings will be paid out as dividends and how much will be retained for reinvestment.
-   Dividend policy can be categorized into three types: residual, stable, and constant payout.
-   The choice of dividend policy can impact a company's stock price, as investors may view a stable dividend policy as a sign of financial strength and stability.

### 4. [[Retained Earnings]]

-   Retained earnings are the portion of a company's net income that is not paid out as dividends but instead reinvested in the business.
-   Retained earnings can be used for various purposes, such as funding business growth, repaying debt, or repurchasing shares.

### 5. [[Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP)]]

-   A dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) is a program offered by many companies that allows shareholders to automatically reinvest their cash dividends in additional shares of the company's stock.
-   DRIPs can be an attractive option for long-term investors, as they provide a way to compound returns over time and acquire additional shares without incurring transaction fees.

## Advantages of Dividends

1.  **Income generation**: Dividends provide a steady source of income for shareholders, which can be particularly valuable for retirees or other investors who rely on investment income.
2.  **Portfolio diversification**: Investing in dividend-paying stocks can help diversify an investment portfolio and reduce overall risk.
3.  **Market signal**: A company's decision to pay or increase dividends can signal financial strength and confidence in future earnings, potentially attracting more investors and driving up the stock price.

## Disadvantages of Dividends

1.  **[[Tax]]ation**: Dividend income is often subject to taxation, which can reduce the net return for investors.
2.  **Limited growth potential**: Companies that pay out a large portion of their earnings as dividends may have less capital available for reinvestment and growth.
3.  **Dividend cuts**: A company may decide to cut or suspend its dividend payments in times of financial distress, which can negatively impact the stock price and the income received by shareholders.
