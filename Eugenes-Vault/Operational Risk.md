## Overview

[[Operational Risk]] refers to the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events. This definition includes legal risk but excludes strategic and reputational risk.

## Key Components of Operational Risk

Operational risk can stem from various sources within a business organization:

- **People**: Risks related to human error, misconduct, or inadequate skill and training. Examples include data entry errors, internal fraud, or unauthorized trading.
    
- **Processes**: Risks related to the design, implementation, and monitoring of business processes. For instance, poorly designed workflows that lead to inefficiencies or errors.
    
- **Systems**: Risks related to IT system failures, software bugs, or cyberattacks.
    
- **External events**: Risks that arise from events beyond the organization's control, such as natural disasters, political unrest, or changes in market conditions.
    

## Operational Risk Management

Managing operational risk involves identifying potential risks, assessing their potential impact, and taking steps to mitigate them. The steps in operational risk management typically include:

- **Risk Identification**: Identification of sources of operational risk is the first step in the process. This may involve reviewing internal processes, conducting employee interviews, or analyzing past incidents.
    
- **Risk Assessment**: Once risks are identified, they must be assessed in terms of their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence.
    
- **Risk Mitigation**: This step involves implementing controls to manage identified risks. These may include process improvements, staff training, system updates, or contingency planning.
    
- **Risk Monitoring**: Ongoing monitoring is necessary to ensure that the implemented controls are effective and to identify new risks that may emerge over time.
    

## Risk Metrics and Models

Different metrics and models are used to quantify operational risk, such as Value-at-Risk (VaR) for operational risk, Expected Shortfall (ES), and scenario analysis. The choice of the model depends on the nature of the business and the specific operational risks it faces.
