## Overview

A shareholder, also known as a [[Stockholder]], is an individual, [[Institution]], or entity that owns [[Share]]s or [[Stock]] in a [[Corporation]]. Shareholders are the owners of a [[Company]] and are entitled to certain rights and privileges, such as voting on corporate matters, receiving [[Dividend]]s, and benefiting from the [[Appreciation]] of the company's stock value.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Types of Shareholders

-   **[[Individual Shareholder]]s**: Individual [[Investor]]s who own shares of a company's stock, typically through a [[Brokerage]] account or retirement plan.
-   **[[Institutional Shareholder]]s**: Large organizations such as [[Pension Fund]]s, [[Mutual Fund]]s, and [[Insurance]] companies that invest in stocks on behalf of their clients or beneficiaries.
-   **[[Insider Shareholder]]s**: Company [[Executive]]s, [[Board Member]]s, and other individuals with a direct connection to the company who own shares of the company's stock.

### 2. Shareholder Rights

-   **Voting rights**: Shareholders typically have the right to vote on major corporate decisions, such as electing members of the board of directors, approving mergers and acquisitions, and adopting changes to the company's bylaws.
-   **Dividend rights**: Shareholders are often entitled to receive dividends when the company distributes a portion of its earnings to its shareholders.
-   **Rights to information**: Shareholders have the right to access certain financial information about the company, such as annual reports, proxy statements, and other disclosures required by securities regulators.

### 3. Shareholder Meetings

-   Shareholders can attend annual general meetings (AGMs) and special meetings to vote on corporate matters and engage directly with the company's management and board of directors.
-   Proxy voting allows shareholders who cannot attend meetings in person to vote on important matters through an appointed representative or by submitting their votes electronically or by mail.

### 4. Shareholder Activism

-   Shareholder activism refers to the efforts of shareholders to influence a company's management and policies through active engagement, such as proposing resolutions, engaging in dialogue with the company's leadership, or taking legal action.
-   Shareholder activism can be driven by a variety of motivations, including concerns about environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues, executive compensation, or company performance.

### 5. Rights Issue

-   A rights issue is an offer by a company to its existing shareholders to purchase additional shares at a discounted price, typically in proportion to their current holdings.
-   Shareholders have the option to exercise their rights and purchase the additional shares or sell their rights to other investors.

## Advantages of Being a Shareholder

1.  **Ownership**: Shareholders have an ownership stake in the company, which can increase in value over time as the company grows and succeeds.
2.  **Income**: Shareholders can receive dividend income from the company's profits, providing a source of passive income.
3.  **Influence**: Shareholders have the ability to influence corporate decision-making through voting on key issues and engaging with the company's management.

## Disadvantages of Being a Shareholder

1.  **Risk**: Shareholders assume the risk of potential declines in the company's stock price, which can result in financial losses.
2.  **Limited control**: While shareholders have voting rights, they may not have significant influence over the company's day-to-day operations or strategic direction.
3.  **Liquidity**: In some cases, shares of a company may be illiquid, making it difficult for shareholders to sell their shares when desired.
