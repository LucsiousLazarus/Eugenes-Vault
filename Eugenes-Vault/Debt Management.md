## Overview

[[Debt Management]] refers to the strategies and tactics employed by individuals and businesses to handle their debt. The goal is to minimize the cost of debt, maintain a good credit score, and ensure the timely repayment of all debts.

## Key Concepts in Debt Management

### Debt Repayment Strategies

Debt repayment strategies aim to efficiently pay off debt, minimizing the overall interest paid. Popular strategies include:

- **The Avalanche Method**: This method focuses on repaying the debt with the highest interest rate first while maintaining minimum payments on other debts.
    
- **The Snowball Method**: This approach prioritizes the smallest debts first, while making minimum payments on larger debts. This provides psychological motivation by quickly eliminating individual debts.
    

### Credit Score

A [[Credit Score]] is a number that represents the creditworthiness of an individual. It's used by lenders to assess the risk of lending money to a potential borrower. Timely repayment of debt, credit utilization, and the mix of credit types impact the credit score.

### Debt Consolidation

[[Debt Consolidation]] involves combining multiple debts into a single, larger piece of debt, usually with more favorable payoff terms. Favorable terms include a lower interest rate, lower monthly payment, or both.

### Refinancing

Refinancing a loan can be another effective debt management strategy. It involves replacing an existing loan with a new loan, typically with a lower interest rate.

### Bankruptcy

As a last resort, bankruptcy might be considered. Bankruptcy can eliminate or reduce debt, but it significantly harms the debtor's credit score.

## Debt Management Plans

A Debt Management Plan (DMP) is a structured repayment plan set up by a third-party agency. DMPs can help individuals manage their debt by negotiating lower interest rates and consolidating payments.
