## Overview

A [[Loan]] is a form of financial aid that must be repaid with interest. The lender (usually a financial institution) provides a sum of money (the principal) to the borrower, who is obligated to repay the principal along with an agreed-upon interest over a specified period.

## Types of Loans

Loans can come in various forms, including:

1. **Personal Loans:** Unsecured loans usually issued based on the borrower's creditworthiness.
    
2. **Mortgages:** Loans used to purchase real estate, where the property itself serves as collateral.
    
3. **Student Loans:** Loans issued to pay for education-related expenses.
    
4. **Auto Loans:** Loans used to purchase vehicles, where the vehicle serves as collateral.
    
5. **Small Business Loans:** Loans granted to businesses for various operational needs.
    
6. **Payday Loans:** Short-term, high-interest loans usually due on the borrower's next payday.
    

## Key Terms
