## Overview

A [[Sales Commission]] is a sum of money paid to an employee upon completion of a task, usually selling a certain amount of goods or services. Employers sometimes use sales commissions as an incentive to increase worker productivity. When a commission is used in addition to a salary, it may be included in the employee's income and subject to taxes.

## Types of Sales Commission Structures

1. **Straight Commission**: Under this model, the employee's entire income is derived from commissions. If they don't make any sales, they don't earn any income.
    
2. **Salary Plus Commission**: In this model, employees receive a fixed base salary plus an additional commission based on the sales they make.
    
3. **Tiered Commission**: In a tiered structure, the commission rate increases as the employee meets certain sales thresholds.
    
4. **Revenue Commission**: This model involves paying a commission based on the revenue generated from sales.
    
5. **Profit Margin Commission**: This model involves paying a commission based on the profit margin of the sales.
    
6. **Territory Volume Commission**: In this model, a sales team is given a commission based on the sales volume of their assigned territory.
    

## Factors Influencing Sales Commission Rates

Several factors can influence the rate of sales commission, including:

1. **Industry Norms**: Different industries have different average commission rates.
    
2. **Profit Margins**: Businesses with higher profit margins can generally afford to pay higher commission rates.
    
3. **Product Complexity**: If a product or service is difficult to sell (either because it's complex, new, or high-cost), higher commission rates may be necessary.
    

## Impact on Business

Sales commission can have a significant impact on business finances. On the one hand, it can incentivize the sales team and increase sales and revenue. On the other hand, high commission rates can also lead to higher business expenses and potentially reduced profits if not managed effectively.
