## Overview

Futures trading is the buying and selling of standardized contracts, known as futures contracts, that obligate the parties to buy or sell a specific asset at a predetermined future date and price. Futures contracts are a type of derivative financial instrument and can be based on a wide variety of underlying assets, including commodities, currencies, stock indices, and interest rates.

## Futures Contracts

A futures contract is an agreement between a buyer and a seller to exchange an asset at a specific price on a predetermined date in the future. The contract specifies:

-   The **underlying asset** being traded (e.g., crude oil, wheat, or an index)
-   The **contract size** (the quantity of the asset per contract)
-   The **delivery date** (when the asset will be exchanged)
-   The **price** (also known as the futures price or contract price)

## Market Participants

Futures trading involves various types of market participants:

1.  **Hedgers**: Businesses or individuals who use futures contracts to mitigate risks associated with price fluctuations of an underlying asset. They take positions in the futures market that are opposite to their positions in the physical market.
2.  **Speculators**: Traders who attempt to profit from price fluctuations in the futures market without any intention of taking delivery of the underlying asset. They take on risk in the hopes of realizing gains based on market movements.
3.  **Arbitrageurs**: Traders who attempt to profit from temporary price discrepancies between the spot market and the futures market or between different futures contracts.

## Trading Strategies

1.  **Going long**: Buying a futures contract with the expectation that the price of the underlying asset will rise before the contract's expiration date, allowing the trader to sell the contract at a higher price.
2.  **Going short**: Selling a futures contract with the expectation that the price of the underlying asset will decline before the contract's expiration date, allowing the trader to buy back the contract at a lower price.
3.  **Spreading**: Simultaneously buying and selling two related futures contracts to profit from the change in the price differential between them. Common types of spreads include calendar spreads, intermarket spreads, and intercommodity spreads.
4.  **Hedging**: Using futures contracts to protect against adverse price movements in the underlying asset, effectively transferring the risk to other market participants.

## Risks and Considerations

1.  **Leverage risk**: Futures trading often involves the use of leverage, which can magnify both gains and losses. A relatively small market movement may have a proportionately larger impact on the funds deposited as margin.
2.  **Liquidity risk**: Futures contracts may become illiquid, making it difficult to close out a position or enter into a new one at a desired price.
3.  **Roll-over risk**: Traders who wish to maintain a position in a futures contract beyond its expiration date need to roll over the position into a new contract, which can involve additional costs and potential slippage.
4.  **Counterparty risk**: The risk that the clearinghouse or the other party involved in the transaction will default on their obligations.
