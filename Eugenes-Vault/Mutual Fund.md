## Overview

A [[Mutual Fund]] is an investment vehicle composed of a portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. Mutual funds are managed by professional [[Investment Managers]] who allocate the fund's investments and attempt to produce capital gains and/or income for the fund's investors.

## Structure

Mutual funds pool money from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of investments. When you invest in a mutual fund, you are buying shares of the mutual fund and become a shareholder of the fund.

## Types of Mutual Funds

There are several types of mutual funds, each with different investment objectives, strategies, and risk levels:

1. **Equity Funds:** Primarily invest in stocks.
    
2. **Bond Funds:** Primarily invest in bonds.
    
3. **Money Market Funds:** Invest in short-term fixed income securities such as government bonds, treasury bills, bankersâ€™ acceptances, commercial paper and certificates of deposit.
    
4. **Balanced Funds:** Invest in a mix of equities and fixed income securities.
    
5. **Index Funds:** Aim to track the performance of a specific index such as the S&P 500.
    
6. **Sector Funds:** Invest in a particular sector of the economy such as technology, healthcare or energy.
    
7. **International/Global Funds:** Invest in assets located anywhere in the world.
    

## Advantages of Mutual Funds

- **Diversification:** Mutual funds invest in a broad range of securities. This practice, known as [[Diversification]], can reduce investment risk.
    
- **Professional Management:** Professional money managers research, select, and monitor the performance of the securities the mutual fund buys.
    
- **Liquidity:** Mutual fund shares can be bought or sold (redeemed) on any day the markets are open.
    

## Disadvantages of Mutual Funds

- **Costs:** Mutual funds charge management fees that are deducted from investment returns. Some funds also charge sales commissions.
    
- **Less Control:** Investors do not have a say in the fund's investment decisions. If the fund makes a bad investment decision, the investment could decline in value.
    
- **Price Uncertainty:** The price of a mutual fund's shares is determined at the end of the trading day, unlike stocks, which fluctuate throughout the day.
