## Overview

A service is a transaction in which no physical goods are transferred from the seller to the buyer. It's often intangible and produced and consumed simultaneously. The key aspect of a service is that it does not involve the transfer of ownership of a tangible asset.

## Characteristics of Services

1.  **Intangibility**: Services cannot be touched, tasted, or seen like a pure product can. They are experiential and subjective.
    
2.  **Inseparability**: Services are produced and consumed simultaneously. They are not produced, stored, and then consumed â€“ at the point of sale, they are consumed while they are being 'produced'.
    
3.  **Variability**: Services are not always the same. They depend on who provides them and when and where they are provided.
    
4.  **Perishability**: Services cannot be stored, saved, or resold once they have been used.

3.  **Public Services**: These are provided by the government to people living within its jurisdiction. They include public transportation, police services, and public healthcare.

## Importance of Services in Economy

The service sector has grown significantly and continues to grow, contributing a significant portion to the GDP in developed economies. This phenomenon is often referred to as the shift towards a "service economy."

Many businesses, especially those in the tech sector, also use a [[Business Model]] known as Software as a Service (SaaS), where users pay to use software hosted on a remote server.
