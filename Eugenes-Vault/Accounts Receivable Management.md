## Overview

Accounts receivable management is the process of ensuring timely collection of outstanding payments from customers while minimizing the risk of bad debts. It involves implementing effective credit policies, monitoring accounts receivable, and taking appropriate actions to collect overdue payments. Proper accounts receivable management is crucial for maintaining a healthy cash flow and ensuring the financial stability of a business.

## Key Components of Accounts Receivable Management
