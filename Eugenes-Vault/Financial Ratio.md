## Overview

Financial ratios are quantitative measures used to assess the financial health, performance, and valuation of a company. They are derived from the financial statements, such as the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. Financial ratios are widely used by investors, analysts, and management to evaluate a company's operational efficiency, profitability, liquidity, solvency, and market valuation. They provide a standardized method for comparing companies within the same industry or sector.

## Types of Financial Ratios

1.  **Liquidity Ratios**: These ratios measure a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations using its liquid assets. Common liquidity ratios include the current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio.
    
2.  **Solvency Ratios**: Solvency ratios evaluate a company's ability to meet its long-term debt obligations and assess its financial stability. Key solvency ratios include the debt-to-equity ratio, equity ratio, and times interest earned ratio.
    
3.  **Profitability Ratios**: Profitability ratios examine a company's ability to generate earnings relative to its revenue, assets, and equity. Common profitability ratios include the gross profit margin, operating profit margin, net profit margin, return on assets (ROA), and return on equity (ROE).
    
4.  **Efficiency Ratios**: These ratios measure how effectively a company is using its resources to generate revenue and profit. Key efficiency ratios include the asset turnover ratio, inventory turnover ratio, and accounts receivable turnover ratio.
    
5.  **Valuation Ratios**: Valuation ratios are used to assess a company's market value relative to its earnings, revenue, or assets. Common valuation ratios include the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, and price-to-book (P/B) ratio.
    

## Limitations of Financial Ratios

1.  **Comparability**: Financial ratios can be less meaningful when comparing companies from different industries or sectors, as they may have different operating structures and financial characteristics.
    
2.  **Historical Data**: Financial ratios are derived from historical financial statements, which may not always reflect a company's current financial condition or future prospects.
    
3.  **Accounting Practices**: Differences in accounting policies and methods can affect the comparability of financial ratios across companies.
    
4.  **Qualitative Factors**: Financial ratios do not capture qualitative factors that may impact a company's performance, such as management quality, competitive advantage, or industry trends.
