## Overview

A stakeholder is a person, group, or organization that has interest or concern in an organization. They can affect or be affected by the organization's actions, objectives, and policies.

Stakeholders can be internal or external to the organization. They can also have either a direct or an indirect stake in the business.

## Types of Stakeholders

There are two main types of stakeholders:

1.  **Internal Stakeholders**: These are individuals or groups within a business, such as employees, owners, or investors.
    
2.  **External Stakeholders**: These are individuals or groups outside of the business but who still have an interest in the business's performance. Examples include customers, suppliers, creditors, unions, government agencies, the local community, and the media.
    

## Stakeholder vs. Shareholder

While the terms "stakeholder" and "[[Shareholder]]" are sometimes used interchangeably, they do not mean the same thing. A shareholder owns part of a public company through shares of stock, while a stakeholder is interested in the company's performance for reasons other than just stock performance.

A shareholder is technically a stakeholder. However, a stakeholder is not necessarily a shareholder.

## Stakeholder Theory

The Stakeholder Theory is a theory of organizational management and business ethics that addresses morals and values in managing an organization. It suggests that stakeholders should be treated as if they were an end in itself. This means considering their needs and interests, not just their potential to help achieve an organization's goals.

The theory was first proposed by R. Edward Freeman in his book "Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach" (1984). It has since gained widespread acceptance in business and is an integral part of modern Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).

## Importance of Stakeholders

Stakeholders are crucial for the success of a business. They provide the business with its necessary resources, and their needs and expectations should therefore be taken into account.

For example, employees offer labor to the business, customers provide revenue, shareholders invest capital, while the community provides the business with a market and a workforce. Mismanagement of stakeholder relations can lead to a loss of these resources, damaging the business.
