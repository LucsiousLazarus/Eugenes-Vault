## Overview

An option is a type of financial derivative that grants the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price (strike price) on or before a specific date (expiration date). Options are used for various purposes, including hedging, speculation, and income generation. They can be traded on exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC).

## Types of Options

There are two main types of options: call options and put options.

1.  **[[Call Option]]**: A call option gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset at the strike price. Call options are typically purchased by investors who believe the price of the underlying asset will increase.
    
2.  **[[Put Option]]**: A put option gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price. Put options are typically purchased by investors who believe the price of the underlying asset will decrease.
    

## Components of an Option

-   **Underlying [[Asset]]**: The asset on which the option is based, such as a stock, bond, commodity, or currency.
    
-   **[[Strike Price]]**: The price at which the option holder can buy (call option) or sell (put option) the underlying asset.
    
-   **[[Expiration Date]]**: The date on which the option contract expires. After this date, the option becomes worthless if not exercised.
    
-   **[[Option Premium]]**: The price that the option buyer pays to the option seller (writer) for the right to buy or sell the underlying asset.
    

## Option Styles

Options can be classified into two main styles based on the exercise rules:

1.  **American Style**: American-style options can be exercised at any time on or before the expiration date.
    
2.  **European Style**: European-style options can only be exercised on the expiration date.
    

## Uses of Options

1.  **[[Hedging]]**: Options can be used to hedge or protect an investment portfolio against adverse price movements. For example, an investor who owns a stock might purchase a put option to protect against a potential decline in the stock's value.
    
2.  **[[Speculation]]**: Options can be used to speculate on the future direction of the price of an underlying asset. For example, an investor who believes that the price of a stock will increase might buy a call option on the stock.
    
3.  **[[Income]] Generation**: Options can be used to generate income through option-writing strategies, such as covered calls or cash-secured puts.
    

## Risks Associated with Options

While options can provide benefits, they also carry risks:

1.  **Loss of Premium**: If an option expires worthless, the option buyer loses the premium paid for the option.
    
2.  **[[Leverage]]**: Options involve leverage, which can magnify gains and losses. A small change in the price of the underlying asset can result in significant gains or losses for the option holder.
    
3.  **[[Time Decay]]**: The value of an option decreases as it approaches its expiration date, a phenomenon known as time decay. This can negatively impact the value of an option, particularly for the option buyer.
    
4.  **Complexity**: Options can be complex and may be difficult for some investors to understand fully.
