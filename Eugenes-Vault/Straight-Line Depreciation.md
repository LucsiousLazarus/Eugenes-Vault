## Overview

Straight-line depreciation is a method of allocating the cost of a tangible fixed asset, such as property, plant, and equipment (PPE), evenly over its useful life. This method is the simplest and most commonly used method of depreciation in accounting and finance, as it assumes that the asset loses its value at a constant rate over time.

## Straight-Line Depreciation Formula

The formula for calculating straight-line depreciation is:

Depreciation Expense = (Cost of Asset - Salvage Value) / Useful Life

1.  **Cost of Asset:** The initial cost of the asset, including any related expenses, such as installation and transportation costs.
2.  **Salvage Value:** The estimated residual value of the asset at the end of its useful life, which is the amount the asset could be sold for after being used.
3.  **Useful Life:** The expected number of years the asset will be in service and generate economic benefits for the company.

## Example

Suppose a company purchases a machine for $10,000 and estimates that the machine has a useful life of 5 years and a salvage value of $2,000. The straight-line depreciation expense would be calculated as follows:

Depreciation Expense = ($10,000 - $2,000) / 5 = $1,600 per year

Each year, the company would record a depreciation expense of $1,600, and the asset's book value would decrease by this amount.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

1.  **Simplicity:** Straight-line depreciation is easy to understand and calculate, making it suitable for companies with limited resources or complex assets.
2.  **Consistency:** This method spreads the cost of the asset evenly over its useful life, making it easier to compare financial performance across periods.

### Disadvantages

1.  **Lack of Realism:** The straight-line method may not accurately reflect the asset's actual pattern of use or decline in value, as some assets may lose value more quickly in the early years of their life.
2.  **Inaccurate Asset Values:** If the actual useful life or salvage value differs significantly from the estimates, the asset's book value may be inaccurate.
