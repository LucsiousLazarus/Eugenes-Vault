## Overview

[[Leverage]] in finance refers to the use of borrowed money (debt) to finance the purchase of assets with the expectation that the income or capital gain from the new asset will exceed the cost of borrowing. Essentially, leverage amplifies the potential returns on an investment but also increases the potential loss if the investment fails.

## Types of Leverage

Leverage can be divided into three main categories:

1. **Financial Leverage**: This refers to the use of debt to finance an organization's operations and investments. A firm with high financial leverage has a higher proportion of debt in its capital structure.
    
2. **Operating Leverage**: This involves using fixed costs in the production process. A company with high operating leverage has higher fixed costs and lower variable costs.
    
3. **Combined Leverage**: This combines both operating and financial leverage and shows the total risk of the firm.
    

## Measures of Leverage

There are several ratios and metrics used to measure the degree of leverage, including:

- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: This compares a company's total debt to its shareholders' equity. A high ratio implies higher leverage.
    
- **Equity Multiplier**: This ratio indicates how much of a company's total assets are financed by stockholders' equity. A lower ratio means higher leverage.
    
- **Degree of Financial Leverage (DFL)**: This measures the sensitivity of a companyâ€™s earnings per share (EPS) to fluctuations in its operating income, as a result of changes in its capital structure.
    

## Impact of Leverage

Leverage can have significant impacts on both businesses and investments:

- **Potential for Higher Returns**: Leverage can amplify profits. If the return on assets purchased with borrowed money exceeds the cost of the borrowed money, the investor's or company's return will be higher than if no debt was used.
    
- **Increased Risk**: Leverage also amplifies potential losses and increases the risk of default. If the return on the assets falls short of the cost of the debt, the investor or company stands to lose more than if the investment was financed solely with equity.
    
- **Tax Implications**: Interest expense on debt is typically tax-deductible for corporations, which can provide a tax shield and make debt a more attractive form of financing than equity.
    

## Leverage in Investing

In investing, leverage is commonly used in several ways:

- **Margin Trading**: Investors can use borrowed money from a brokerage to buy securities, amplifying potential gains and losses.
    
- **Leveraged ETFs**: These are exchange-traded funds that use financial derivatives and debt to amplify the returns of an underlying index.
    
- **Real Estate**: In real estate, mortgages allow individuals to make large property investments with a relatively small amount of equity.
