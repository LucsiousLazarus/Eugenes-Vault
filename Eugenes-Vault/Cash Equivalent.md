## Overview

Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are easily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. They are included in the calculation of a company's cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet and are considered assets.

## Examples of Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents typically include:

1.  **[[Treasury Bill]]s**: These are short-term government securities with maturities of less than one year. They are considered safe investments due to the creditworthiness of the government.
    
2.  **[[Money Market Fund]]s**: Money market funds are investment funds that invest in short-term debt securities. They aim to maintain a stable value of 1 unit of currency per share and generate income.
    
3.  **[[Commercial Paper]]**: This is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations. It typically has a maturity of less than 270 days.
    
4.  **[[Short-term Government Bond]]s**: Bonds with a maturity of less than one year issued by the government can also be considered cash equivalents.
    
5.  **[[Banker's Acceptance]]s**: These are short-term debt instruments issued by a company that are guaranteed by a commercial bank.
    

## Accounting for Cash Equivalents

According to accounting standards, for an investment to qualify as a cash equivalent, it must be readily convertible to a known amount of cash and be close to its maturity so that there is insignificant risk of changes in value due to changes in interest rates. Typically, investments are considered to be cash equivalents if they have a maturity period of three months or less from the date of acquisition.

## Importance in Financial Analysis

Cash equivalents are important in financial analysis because they represent a company's short-term liquidity. The higher a company's cash and cash equivalents, the more capable it is of covering its short-term liabilities. Cash equivalents also contribute to a company's operational cash flow, which is a key indicator of a company's financial health.
