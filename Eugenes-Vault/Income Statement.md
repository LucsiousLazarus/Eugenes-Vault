## Overview

The income statement, also known as the statement of operations or profit and loss statement, is a financial statement that summarizes a company's revenues, expenses, and profits or losses over a specific period, usually a fiscal quarter or year. It provides insight into a company's profitability, efficiency, and operating performance. The income statement is one of the three main financial statements, along with the balance sheet and cash flow statement.

The income statement is organized into several key sections, which include revenues, cost of goods sold (COGS), gross profit, operating expenses, operating income, non-operating income and expenses, income taxes, and net income.

## [[Revenue]]s

Revenues, also known as sales, are the earnings generated from a company's primary business activities, such as the sale of goods or services. Revenues are typically reported at the top of the income statement and may be broken down into different categories, such as product sales and service revenues.

## [[Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)]]

Cost of goods sold (COGS) represents the direct costs incurred in producing or acquiring the goods or services sold by a company. COGS typically includes labor costs, raw materials, and manufacturing overhead. It is deducted from revenues to calculate gross profit.

## [[Gross Profit]]

Gross profit is the difference between revenues and COGS. It represents the amount of money a company has left over after covering the direct costs of producing or acquiring the goods or services it sells.

## [[Operating Expenses]]

Operating expenses include all indirect costs related to a company's core business operations, such as selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses, research and development (R&D) expenses, and depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses are deducted from gross profit to calculate operating income.

## [[Operating Income]]

Operating income, also known as operating profit or operating earnings, represents the income generated from a company's core business operations, excluding non-operating income and expenses. Operating income is an important indicator of a company's operating performance and efficiency.

## [[Non-Operating Income and Expenses]]

Non-operating income and expenses include items that are not directly related to a company's core business operations, such as gains or losses from the sale of assets, interest income, and interest expenses. These items are added or subtracted from operating income to calculate income before taxes.

## [[Income Tax]]es

Income taxes represent a company's tax liability on its taxable income, which is calculated by adjusting its income before taxes for various tax-related items, such as deductions and tax credits. Income taxes are deducted from income before taxes to calculate net income.

## [[Net Income]]

Net income, also known as net profit or net earnings, represents the bottom line of the income statement. It is the final result of a company's revenues, expenses, and taxes, and it reflects a company's overall profitability during the reporting period.

## [[Earnings Per Share (EPS)]]

Earnings per share (EPS) is a key financial metric that represents the portion of a company's net income allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
