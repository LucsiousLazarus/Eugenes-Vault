## Overview

Future Value (FV) refers to the value of an investment or cash flow at a specified point in the future, taking into account the time value of money. In finance, the FV concept is essential in various areas, such as retirement planning, capital budgeting, and valuation. Calculating the FV helps investors determine the potential growth of their investments over time.

## Future Value of a Single Sum (FVSS)

The formula for calculating the future value of a single sum is:

FV = PV * (1 + r)^n

-   FV: future value
-   PV: present value
-   r: interest rate per period
-   n: number of periods

This formula calculates the FV of a single sum invested or saved today, given a certain interest rate and the number of periods.

## Future Value of an Annuity (FVA)

An annuity is a series of equal cash flows made at regular intervals over a specified period. The formula for calculating the future value of an annuity is:

FVA = Pmt * (((1 + r)^n - 1) / r)

-   FVA: future value of an annuity
-   Pmt: payment amount per period
-   r: interest rate per period
-   n: number of periods

This formula calculates the FV of a series of equal payments (annuity) made over a certain number of periods, given a specific interest rate.

## Factors Affecting Future Value

1.  **Interest Rate**: Higher interest rates result in higher future values, as money invested at a higher rate grows faster over time.
2.  **Time Horizon**: The longer the investment period, the higher the future value, assuming a positive interest rate.
3.  **Frequency of Compounding**: The more frequently interest is compounded, the higher the future value, as the investment has more opportunities to grow.

## Applications of Future Value

1.  **Retirement Planning**: FV calculations help individuals determine the potential growth of their savings and investments over time, which is crucial for retirement planning.
2.  **Capital Budgeting**: Businesses use FV calculations to evaluate the potential profitability of investments by estimating the future value of expected cash flows.
3.  **Valuation**: FV is used to determine the future value of assets, which is essential for valuing investments and businesses.
