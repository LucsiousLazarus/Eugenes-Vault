## Overview

The Present Value of an Annuity (PVA) is the current value of a series of equal cash flows (annuity) that occur at regular intervals in the future, discounted at a specific interest rate. It is a useful concept in finance and investing to determine the value of investments that generate periodic cash flows, such as bonds, mortgages, or retirement savings.

## Formula

The formula for calculating the present value of an annuity is:

PVA = C * [(1 - (1 + r)^(-t)) / r]

-   PVA: present value of the annuity
-   C: cash flow per period
-   r: interest rate (in decimal) per period
-   t: total number of periods

## Example

Suppose an investor wants to determine the present value of an annuity that pays $1,000 per year for 5 years, discounted at an annual interest rate of 5%. Using the PVA formula:

PVA = $1,000 * [(1 - (1 + 0.05)^(-5)) / 0.05] PVA â‰ˆ $4,329.48

The present value of the annuity is approximately $4,329.48.

## Applications

1.  **Investment Evaluation**: PVA can be used to evaluate investments that generate periodic cash flows, such as bonds, by comparing the present value of the cash flows to the initial investment cost.
2.  **Retirement Planning**: PVA can be used to calculate the current value of a retirement savings plan that generates periodic income, helping individuals to plan for their future needs.
3.  **Loan Amortization**: Lenders use PVA to determine the present value of a series of loan repayments, which can be used to calculate the initial loan amount.
