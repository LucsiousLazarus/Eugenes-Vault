## Overview

[[Loan Amortization]] is the process of gradually reducing a debt through scheduled, periodic payments. The payments are typically made monthly and consist of both principal and interest.

## Key Components of Loan Amortization

1. **Principal:** This is the initial amount of the loan that is borrowed. Over time, payments will gradually reduce this amount until it reaches zero at the end of the loan term.
    
2. **Interest:** This is the cost of borrowing the principal amount and is calculated as a percentage of the unpaid principal.
    
3. **Amortization Schedule:** This is a complete table of periodic loan payments, showing the amount of principal and the amount of interest that comprises each payment until the loan is paid off at the end of its term.
    

## Amortization Process

Each scheduled payment is applied towards the interest first, with the remainder of the payment reducing the principal. As the principal decreases, the interest charge per period also decreases. This results in an increasing amount of each payment being applied towards the principal as the loan matures.

## Types of Amortization

- **Straight Line (Linear):** The principal amount decreases at a constant rate throughout the loan term.
    
- **Declining Balance (Reducing Balance):** The principal decreases at a rate proportional to its current value.
    
- **Bullet (Balloon):** The full principal amount is paid at once at the end of the loan term.
    
- **Negative Amortization:** The payments made are less than the interest charges. The unpaid interest is added to the principal, causing the loan balance to increase over time.
    

## Importance

Amortization allows borrowers to predict their debt situation in the future, making long-term financial planning easier. Furthermore, it allows the borrowers to pay off debt over time, reducing the burden of a large lump-sum payment.
