## Overview

A corporation is a separate legal entity formed by one or more individuals or organizations to engage in business activities. Unlike sole proprietorships and partnerships, corporations offer limited liability protection to their owners (shareholders), meaning they are not personally responsible for the company's debts and obligations. Corporations are subject to different tax treatment and regulatory requirements than other business structures and are typically more complex to establish and maintain.

## Key Characteristics

1.  **Legal Entity**: A corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners, which means it can enter into contracts, own property, and sue or be sued in its own name. This separation provides limited liability protection for the shareholders, who are not personally responsible for the company's debts and obligations (unless they have provided personal guarantees).
    
2.  **Ownership**: A corporation's ownership is represented by shares, which are units of equity that can be bought, sold, or transferred among individuals or organizations. Shareholders are the owners of a corporation, and their ownership interest is proportional to the number of shares they hold.
    
3.  **Management**: The day-to-day management of a corporation is typically handled by its directors and officers, who are responsible for making decisions, setting strategy, and overseeing operations. Directors are elected by shareholders, while officers (such as the CEO, CFO, and COO) are appointed by the board of directors.
    
4.  **Taxation**: Corporations are subject to different tax treatment than other business structures. In many jurisdictions, corporations are taxed on their profits at the corporate level, and shareholders are taxed again on their dividend income. This double taxation can be a disadvantage for some business owners; however, some corporations may qualify for special tax treatment or deductions that can offset this burden.
    
5.  **Regulatory Requirements**: Corporations face stricter regulatory requirements than other business structures, including annual reporting, financial statement audits (for public companies), and shareholder meetings. These requirements can increase the administrative burden and cost of operating a corporation.
    

## Types of Corporations

1.  **[[C-Corporation]]**: A traditional corporation that is subject to double taxation, as both the corporation and its shareholders are taxed on the company's profits. C-corporations can have an unlimited number of shareholders and can raise capital through the issuance of stock.
    
2.  **[[S-Corporation]]**: A type of corporation that is not subject to double taxation. Instead, profits and losses are "passed through" to the shareholders and are taxed at their individual tax rates. S-corporations are subject to certain restrictions, such as a limit on the number of shareholders and limitations on the types of shareholders that are allowed.
    
3.  **[[Nonprofit Corporation]]**: A corporation formed for charitable, educational, or other non-commercial purposes. Nonprofit corporations are exempt from federal income tax and are eligible to receive tax-deductible contributions from donors.
    
4.  **Public vs. Private Corporation**: A public corporation has its shares listed on a public stock exchange, making them available for purchase by the general public. Private corporations are not listed on public exchanges, and their shares are held by a smaller group of investors.
