## Overview

At the Money (ATM) is a term used in options trading to describe an option contract whose strike price is equal or very close to the current market price of the underlying asset. ATM options have no [[Intrinsic Value]] or a minimal amount, and their value is mostly derived from their [[Time Value]] and extrinsic factors such as implied volatility.

## [[Call Option]]s

A call option is ATM when the strike price is equal or very close to the current market price of the underlying asset. In this situation, exercising the option would mean buying the asset at nearly the same price as the market value.

**Example**: An investor holds a call option on [[Company]] XYZ with a [[Strike Price]] of $50. If the current market price of Company XYZ's stock is also $50, the call option is ATM.

## [[Put Option]]s

A put option is ATM when the strike price is equal or very close to the current market price of the underlying asset. In this case, exercising the option would mean selling the asset at nearly the same price as the market value.

**Example**: An investor holds a put option on Company XYZ with a strike price of $50. If the current market price of Company XYZ's stock is also $50, the put option is ATM.

## [[Intrinsic Value]]

ATM options have no intrinsic value or a minimal amount because exercising the option does not result in any significant profit or loss for the option holder. Instead, their value is derived primarily from their time value and extrinsic factors such as implied volatility.

## Relationship with Time Value

ATM options typically have a higher premium compared to out-of-the-money (OTM) options, as they have a greater probability of moving in-the-money before expiration. However, their premiums are generally lower than those of in-the-money (ITM) options, which have intrinsic value.

## Trading Implications

ATM options are often used in various trading strategies that capitalize on an underlying asset's price or volatility changes. Traders may use ATM options for strategies such as covered calls, protective puts, and calendar spreads. ATM options can also be used as a part of more complex strategies like iron condors and butterflies.
