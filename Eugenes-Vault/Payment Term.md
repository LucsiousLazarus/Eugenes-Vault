## Overview

Payment Terms refer to the conditions under which a seller will complete a sale. Typically, these terms specify the period that a buyer has to pay off the amount due, and could include an incentive for payment within a specific time period.

## Common Types of Payment Terms

1.  **Net D**: The net amount of the invoice is due within "D" days. For example, if a supplier offers terms of "Net 30", the full amount of the invoice is due within 30 days of the invoice date.
    
2.  **COD (Cash On Delivery)**: Payment is to be made at the time of delivery, providing assurance to the seller that they will receive payment in return for the delivery of goods.
    
3.  **CIA (Cash In Advance)**: The buyer needs to make payment before the goods are produced or delivered. This term is often used for custom products or orders with a significant value.
    
4.  **EOM (End of Month)**: The payment is due at the end of the month in which the invoice is received.
    
5.  **2/10 Net 30**: This term offers a 2% discount if the invoice is paid within 10 days. If the invoice isn't paid within the first 10 days to receive the discount, the balance is due in 30 days.
    

## Significance of Payment Terms

Choosing the right payment terms is crucial for a business. Shorter payment terms can improve cash flow, but may deter some customers. Longer payment terms may attract more customers but can negatively impact cash flow. A balance must be found based on the business's cash flow needs, the industry standards, and the nature of the business relationship.

Effective management of payment terms requires an understanding of working capital management and cash conversion cycles. Businesses often have to negotiate with both their suppliers and customers to optimize their cash position.
