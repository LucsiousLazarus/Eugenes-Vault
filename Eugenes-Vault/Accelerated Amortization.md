## Overview

Accelerated Amortization refers to an accounting method that expenses the cost of an intangible asset faster than a straight-line method. This method results in higher amortization expenses in the earlier years of the asset's life and lower expenses in the later years.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Higher Initial Expense:** This method results in higher costs at the beginning of the asset's life. The idea is that most assets are more useful when they are new, and their productivity diminishes over time.
    
2. **Reduced Tax Liability:** Higher expenses imply lower net income, thus reducing the tax liability in the early years.
    
3. **Reflects Asset Usage:** The accelerated amortization method better reflects the use and benefit derived from certain assets, especially those that lose value quickly.
    

## Common Methods of Accelerated Amortization

The two most commonly used methods of accelerated amortization are:

1. **Double Declining Balance:** This method doubles the straight-line depreciation rate. For example, if the straight-line depreciation of an asset is 20%, the depreciation rate for double declining balance would be 40%.
    
2. **Sum-of-Years' Digits:** This method adds up the digits for each year of the asset's useful life. For a 5-year life, this would be: 5+4+3+2+1=15. The expense is then a fraction of the decreasing sum of years.
    

## Impact on Financial Statements

Accelerated amortization affects several items on the financial statements:

1. **Balance Sheet:** It decreases the value of intangible assets more rapidly.
    
2. **Income Statement:** It increases expenses, thereby decreasing net income in the earlier years.
    
3. **Cash Flow Statement:** Although it does not impact the cash flow from operating activities directly (as it is a non-cash expense), it can affect the income taxes paid, which is a cash outflow.
    

## Usage and Considerations

The choice between accelerated and straight-line amortization depends on the nature of the asset and the company's financial and tax strategies. Accelerated amortization can be beneficial for companies that want to reduce their taxable income in the early years of an asset's life.
