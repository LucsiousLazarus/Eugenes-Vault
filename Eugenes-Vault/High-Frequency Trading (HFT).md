## Overview

[[High-Frequency Trading (HFT)]] is a type of algorithmic trading that utilizes powerful computers to transact a large number of orders in fractions of a second. This form of trading leverages complex algorithms and technological advancements to trade at extremely high speeds and volume.

## Characteristics of High-Frequency Trading

1. **Speed**: HFT firms employ sophisticated algorithms and computer systems that allow them to execute trades within microseconds or milliseconds, making the speed of execution a defining characteristic.
    
2. **High Volume**: HFT strategies often involve a large number of transactions to take advantage of small price discrepancies. As a result, these strategies frequently generate high trading volumes.
    
3. **Automated Trading**: High-frequency trading is fully automated, meaning that the computers execute all trades without any human intervention. This automation is crucial because it allows for the rapid execution of a large number of trades.
    

## Strategies Used in HFT

- **[[Market Making]]**: High-frequency traders often act as market makers, buying and selling securities to provide liquidity to the market. They earn the bid-ask spread while managing risk carefully.
    
- **[[Arbitrage]]**: HFT firms use arbitrage strategies to take advantage of price differences in different markets or different securities. [[Temporal Arbitrage]] is a particular kind of arbitrage used in HFT.
    
- **Statistical Arbitrage**: This strategy involves complex mathematical models to identify trading opportunities, typically involving a large number of securities for short periods.
    

## HFT and Market Impact

High-frequency trading has a significant influence on the global financial markets. Proponents argue that HFT improves market liquidity, narrows bid-ask spreads, and enhances market efficiency. However, critics express concerns about HFT contributing to market instability, exacerbating volatility, and creating an uneven playing field that favors HFT firms over other market participants.

## High-Frequency Trading and Regulation

Given the speed and volume of high-frequency trading, regulators worldwide scrutinize it. HFT's role in events like the 2010 Flash Crash has led to calls for more regulation and transparency in this area.
