3.  **Legal protection**: Invoices serve as a legal record of the sale, which can be useful in the event of disputes or audits.
    
4.  **Accountability and tracking**: They provide a way to track sales, inventory, and the performance of sales staff.
    
5.  **Tax purposes**: They provide a record of revenue for tax reporting purposes.
