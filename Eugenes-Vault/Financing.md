## Overview

[[Financing]] refers to the process of providing funds for business activities, making purchases or investing. It is a broad term that describes the activity and process of managing money and includes activities such as lending, borrowing, saving, investing, and budgeting.

## Types of Financing

Financing can broadly be categorized into two types:

1. **Debt Financing:** This involves borrowing money that must be repaid over a period of time, usually with interest. Examples include bank loans, credit card debt, bonds, and mortgages.
    
2. **Equity Financing:** This involves raising money by selling shares of ownership in a company. In this case, the investor becomes a shareholder and may receive dividends as a share of the profits.
    

## Debt Financing

The most common forms of debt financing include:

- **Loans:** A sum of money that is borrowed and expected to be paid back with interest. The two major types of loans are secured (backed by collateral) and unsecured loans (not backed by collateral).
    
- **Bonds:** A bond is a form of debt where the issuer promises to pay the bondholder the principal amount plus interest on a specified date.
    
- **Leases:** This involves a contract where the lessor (owner) provides the lessee (user) the right to use an asset for a specified time period in return for regular payments.
    

## Equity Financing

Equity financing is typically used by non-established businesses that do not have sufficient cash flow or collateral to secure debt financing. Types of equity financing include:

- **Common Shares:** The sale of common shares is the most common form of equity financing. Shareholders have a claim on a portion of the profits (dividends) and have a voting right in the company.
    
- **Preferred Shares:** Preferred shareholders have a higher claim on the company's assets and earnings than common shareholders. These shareholders receive dividends before common shareholders and have a fixed dividend rate.
    
- **Venture Capital:** This involves investors providing financing to start-ups and small businesses with perceived long-term growth potential.
    

## Role of Financing in the Economy

Financing plays a crucial role in the economy as it provides businesses with the capital needed to grow and expand. By making funds available, financing helps businesses create jobs, innovate, and contribute to economic growth. Furthermore, by providing consumers with loans (such as mortgages and car loans), financing allows consumers to make big-ticket purchases, which also stimulates economic growth.
