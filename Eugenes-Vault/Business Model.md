## Overview

A [[Business Model]] is a conceptual structure that supports the viability of a business and explains how it operates, makes money, and how it intends to achieve its goals. All the business processes and policies are an integral part of the business model.

## Components of a Business Model

The following are the key components of a business model:

- **Value Proposition**: This is the product or service that the business offers. It is the primary reason why a customer would want to purchase from the business.
- **Revenue Model**: This part defines the ways in which the business earns revenue. It might include selling products, offering subscriptions, or charging for services.
- **Market Segment**: This defines the specific demographic or sector of the market that the business targets.
- **Value Chain Structure**: The business model must include the organization's position in the value chain and detail the activities that it performs.
- **Cost Structure and Profit Margin**: This includes all the business's costs and the margin that it expects to keep after deducting these costs from the revenue.

## Types of Business Models

Different types of businesses have different business models. Some common types include:

- **Direct Sales Model**: Companies sell their product directly to the consumer.
- **Franchise Model**: A franchisor licenses its brand and operational model to a franchisee.
- **Freemium Model**: Basic services are provided free of charge while more advanced features must be paid for.
- **Subscription Model**: Users pay a recurring fee to access a product or service.
- **E-commerce Model**: Goods or services are sold over the internet.

## Importance of a Business Model

A well-defined business model is crucial for any business as it serves as a blueprint for the company's strategy and the path that it will follow to become profitable. It guides the company's decisions and direction. Investors and lenders often scrutinize a business's model to evaluate its viability and potential for return on investment.
