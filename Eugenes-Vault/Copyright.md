## Overview

A copyright is a form of intellectual property protection provided by the laws of many countries to original works of authorship. This includes literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and certain other intellectual works, both published and unpublished. A copyright grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights to determine and decide whether, and under what conditions, this original work may be used by others.

## Key Concepts

1. **Protection:** Copyright laws grant a bundle of exclusive rights, including the right to reproduce, distribute, display, and perform the work, and to create derivative works.
    
2. **Term:** In most countries, copyright lasts for the life of the author plus 50 to 100 years.
    
3. **Registration:** While copyright protection is automatic upon creation of a work in tangible form, registration of copyright can provide additional benefits, such as public notice of the copyright claim.
    
4. **Infringement:** Unauthorized use of copyrighted material in a way that violates one of the copyright owner's exclusive rights, such as the right to reproduce or perform the copyrighted work, or to make derivative works, can be considered copyright infringement.
    
5. **Fair Use:** This is a legal doctrine that promotes freedom of expression by permitting the unlicensed use of copyright-protected works in certain circumstances, such as commentary, criticism, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
    

## Copyright in Business

Businesses often have valuable assets in the form of copyrighted materials, such as software, advertising copy, manuals, and website content. Copyright protection helps businesses protect these assets and prevent unauthorized use by competitors or others. It's an integral part of a business's overall intellectual property strategy, along with patents, trademarks, and trade secrets.

## Global Copyright Laws

Copyright laws are territorial, and the extent of protection depends on the laws of the country where protection is sought. However, there are international treaties, like the Berne Convention, that require the countries to recognize each other's copyrighted works.
