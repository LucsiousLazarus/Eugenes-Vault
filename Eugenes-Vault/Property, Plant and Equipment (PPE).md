## Overview

Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) are tangible, long-lived assets that a company acquires, constructs, or improves and uses in its operations to generate revenue. PPE is classified as a fixed asset on the balance sheet and is subject to depreciation over its useful life. Examples of PPE include land, buildings, machinery, vehicles, and furniture.

## Components of PPE

1.  **Land**: Real estate owned by the company, used for operations, or held for future development. Land is not subject to depreciation.
    
2.  **Buildings**: Structures such as offices, warehouses, and manufacturing facilities owned by the company and used in operations.
    
3.  **Machinery**: Equipment used in the production process or to provide services, such as machines, tools, and production lines.
    
4.  **Vehicles**: Company-owned cars, trucks, and other transportation assets used in operations.
    
5.  **Furniture and Fixtures**: Office furniture, lighting, and other fixtures used in company facilities.
    

## Acquisition and Capital Expenditures

When a company acquires or constructs a PPE asset, the costs associated with the acquisition or construction are capitalized and recorded as an asset on the balance sheet. Capital expenditures (CapEx) are investments made by the company to acquire, maintain, or improve PPE assets.

Capitalized costs can include:

-   Purchase price
-   Sales taxes
-   Legal fees
-   Transportation costs
-   Installation costs

## Depreciation

Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the cost of a PPE asset over its useful life. The purpose of depreciation is to match the cost of the asset to the periods in which it contributes to the generation of revenue.

There are several methods to calculate depreciation, including:

1.  **Straight-Line Method**: Allocates an equal amount of depreciation expense for each year of the asset's useful life.
2.  **Double-Declining Balance Method**: Accelerated depreciation method that allocates higher depreciation expenses in the early years of an asset's life and lower expenses in later years.
3.  **Units of Production Method**: Depreciation expense is based on the actual usage or production volume of the asset.

## Impairment

If the carrying value of a PPE asset exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e., the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use), the asset is considered impaired. Impairment losses must be recognized in the income statement, reducing the carrying value of the asset on the balance sheet.

## Disposal of PPE

When a company disposes of a PPE asset, it removes the asset's carrying value and accumulated depreciation from the balance sheet. Any difference between the disposal proceeds and the net book value of the asset is recognized as a gain or loss on the income statement.
