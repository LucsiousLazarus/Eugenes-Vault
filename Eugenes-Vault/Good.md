## Overview

In economics, a good refers to a tangible product or item that satisfies a human want or need. Goods are items that are touchable, such as books, pens, salt, shoes, hats, and folders.

Goods are often divided into two categories: Consumer Goods and Capital Goods.

## Consumer Goods

Consumer goods, also known as final goods, are used by the end consumers or households. They are purchased for direct use or consumption. They can further be classified into:

1.  **Durable Goods**: These are goods that can be used or consumed over a long period, typically over a year. Examples include cars, appliances, and furniture.
    
2.  **Non-Durable Goods**: These are goods that are immediately consumed in one use or have a lifespan of less than three years. Examples include food and beverages.
    

## Capital Goods

Capital goods are tangible assets such as buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles and tools that an organization uses to produce goods or services to produce consumer goods and goods for other businesses. They are used over a long period and are typically expensive to purchase.

## Demand for Goods

The [[Demand]] for a good is influenced by several factors, including price, income, preferences, and expectations about future prices and income.

## Supply of Goods

The [[Supply]] of a good refers to the amount of goods a market or industry is willing and able to produce and sell, given a certain price level.

## Impact on Economy

Goods play a vital role in the economy. The production, distribution, and consumption of goods form the basis of the economy's health. The [[Gross Domestic Product (GDP)]] of a nation includes the value of goods produced within the country.
