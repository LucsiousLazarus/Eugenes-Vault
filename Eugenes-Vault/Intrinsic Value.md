## Overview

Intrinsic value is a measure of the actual value of an asset or investment, independent of external factors such as market price or sentiment. In finance, intrinsic value is used to evaluate the true worth of stocks, options, bonds, or any other financial instrument. It is a fundamental concept in value investing and is used to determine whether an asset is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly valued.

## Intrinsic Value in Stock Valuation

In stock valuation, intrinsic value is the present value of a company's future cash flows discounted back to today. It is an estimate of what a stock should be worth based on the company's financial performance, growth prospects, and risk factors. Intrinsic value can be calculated using various methods, such as discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, dividend discount model (DDM), or earnings multiple approaches.

**Example**: If a company's intrinsic value is estimated to be $50 per share, and its current market price is $40, it is considered undervalued. Conversely, if the market price is $60, it is considered overvalued.

## Intrinsic Value in Options

In options trading, intrinsic value refers to the difference between the option's strike price and the market price of the underlying asset when the option is in-the-money (ITM). Intrinsic value is always a positive value or zero; it cannot be negative.

-   **Call Option**: Intrinsic value is the difference between the market price of the underlying asset and the strike price, but only if the market price is above the strike price. Otherwise, the intrinsic value is zero.
-   **Put Option**: Intrinsic value is the difference between the strike price and the market price of the underlying asset, but only if the market price is below the strike price. Otherwise, the intrinsic value is zero.

## Time Value and [[Extrinsic Value]]

The total value of an option is the sum of its intrinsic value and its time value. Time value represents the option's potential to gain value as time progresses and is influenced by factors such as time to expiration, implied volatility, and interest rates. Together, intrinsic value and time value make up an option's extrinsic value, which is the total value of an option excluding its intrinsic value.

## Importance in Investment Decisions

Intrinsic value is a key concept in value investing, as it helps investors determine the true worth of an asset or investment. By comparing an asset's intrinsic value to its current market price, investors can make informed decisions about whether to buy, sell, or hold the asset. Value investors seek to identify undervalued assets that have the potential to appreciate in value over time.
