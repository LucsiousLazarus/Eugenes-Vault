## Overview

A mortgage is a long-term loan used to finance the purchase of a home or real estate property. The borrower pledges the property as collateral to secure the loan. The lender (usually a bank or financial institution) provides the funds to buy the property, and the borrower makes regular payments, including interest, to repay the loan over a specified period.

## Key Components

1.  **[[Principal Amount]]**: The original amount of the loan, which the borrower is required to repay.
2.  **[[Interest Rate]]**: The cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage of the principal, charged by the lender over the loan term.
3.  **[[Term Length]]**: The length of time the borrower has to repay the loan, typically ranging from 15 to 30 years.
4.  **[[Amortization]]**: The process of paying off a mortgage loan through regular payments that cover both principal and interest.
5.  **[[Down Payment]]**: The initial payment made by the borrower, representing a percentage of the property's purchase price, to secure the loan.
6.  **[[Collateral]]**: The property being purchased, which serves as security for the loan. In case the borrower defaults, the lender can seize and sell the property to recover the loan amount.

## Types of Mortgages

1.  **Fixed-Rate Mortgage**: A mortgage with a fixed interest rate for the entire loan term, resulting in predictable monthly payments.
2.  **Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)**: A mortgage with an interest rate that can change periodically, based on market conditions or an index rate.
3.  **Interest-Only Mortgage**: A mortgage in which the borrower pays only the interest portion for a specified period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing mortgage.
4.  **Balloon Mortgage**: A mortgage with a large lump-sum payment due at the end of the loan term, often requiring refinancing or sale of the property to meet the obligation.

## Mortgage Process

1.  **Application**: The borrower submits a mortgage application to the lender, providing personal and financial information.
2.  **Pre-approval**: The lender reviews the borrower's credit, income, and financial history to determine the loan amount they are willing to lend.
3.  **Property Appraisal**: The lender orders an appraisal to determine the market value of the property and ensure it is sufficient collateral for the loan.
4.  **Underwriting**: The lender assesses the borrower's ability to repay the loan, taking into account credit score, debt-to-income ratio, and other factors.
5.  **Closing**: The borrower and lender sign the mortgage documents, and the loan funds are disbursed. The borrower takes possession of the property and begins making mortgage payments.

## Mortgage-Related Costs

1.  **Interest**: The cost of borrowing money, charged by the lender over the loan term.
2.  **Closing Costs**: Fees associated with the mortgage process, including origination fees, appraisal fees, and title insurance.
3.  **Property Taxes**: Annual taxes imposed by local governments, based on the assessed value of the property.
4.  **Homeowners Insurance**: Insurance that covers the property against damage, theft, and liability, often required by the lender.
5.  **Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)**: Insurance that protects the lender in case the borrower defaults on the loan, typically required for loans with a down payment below 20% of the property value.
