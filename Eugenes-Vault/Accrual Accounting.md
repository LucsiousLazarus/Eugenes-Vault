## Overview

Accrual accounting is a financial reporting method in which revenues and expenses are recorded when they are earned or incurred, rather than when cash is received or paid. This approach provides a more accurate picture of a company's financial health, as it reflects the economic substance of transactions and events, rather than merely their cash flow timing.

Accrual accounting is based on the accrual principle, which states that financial events should be recognized in the financial statements when they occur, rather than when cash is exchanged. This principle is one of the main building blocks of the [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)]], which govern financial reporting in the United States and many other countries.

## Key Concepts

1.  **[[Revenue Recognition]]**: Under accrual accounting, revenue is recognized when it is earned, which means that goods or services have been provided to the customer, and there is a reasonable expectation of payment. This may occur before, during, or after the receipt of cash.
    
2.  **[[Expense Recognition]]**: Expenses are recognized when they are incurred, which means that the company has received goods or services and has an obligation to pay for them. This may occur before, during, or after the payment of cash.
    
3.  **[[Accrual]]s**: Accruals are adjustments made to recognize revenues or expenses that have been earned or incurred but not yet recorded in the financial statements. Accruals may involve adjusting entries for items such as interest, taxes, or salaries that are payable or receivable at the end of an accounting period.
    
4.  **[[Deferral]]s**: Deferrals are adjustments made to postpone the recognition of revenues or expenses that have been received or paid in cash but have not yet been earned or incurred. Examples of deferrals include prepaid expenses (such as insurance premiums) or unearned revenues (such as customer deposits).
    
5.  **[[Adjusting Entries]]**: Adjusting entries are journal entries made at the end of an accounting period to ensure that the financial statements accurately reflect the accrual basis of accounting. These entries may involve accruals, deferrals, or other adjustments to account for events or transactions that have not yet been fully recorded.
    

## Accrual vs. [[Cash Accounting]]

Accrual accounting is different from cash accounting, which records revenues and expenses only when cash is received or paid. While cash accounting is simpler and more straightforward, it can provide a less accurate picture of a company's financial performance, as it does not account for the timing differences between earning revenues or incurring expenses and the related cash flows.

For most businesses, especially larger ones, accrual accounting is the preferred method, as it provides a more accurate and comprehensive view of the company's financial position and performance.
