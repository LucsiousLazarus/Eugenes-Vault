## Overview

Currency is a medium of exchange for goods and services in an economy. It's a crucial aspect of a country's financial system and plays a vital role in facilitating trade, both domestically and internationally.

## Types of Currency

1.  **[[Fiat Currency]]**: This is legal tender whose value is backed by the government that issued it, not by a physical commodity like gold or silver. Most modern currencies, like the US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), and British Pound (GBP), are fiat currencies.
    
2.  **[[Commodity Currency]]**: This is currency that is linked to the value of a specific commodity, such as gold or oil.
    
3.  **Digital or [[Cryptocurrency]]**: This is a type of currency that uses digital files as money. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) are examples of cryptocurrencies.
    

## Foreign Exchange (Forex) Market

The foreign exchange market, or Forex, is where currencies are traded. It's the largest financial market in the world, with trillions of dollars in transactions every day. In this market, currencies are traded in pairs (e.g., EUR/USD or GBP/USD).

## Exchange Rates

An exchange rate is the price of one country's currency in relation to another. It can be determined through various factors including interest rates, inflation rates, political stability, economic performance, etc.
