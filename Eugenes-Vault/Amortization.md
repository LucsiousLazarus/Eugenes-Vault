## Overview

Amortization is the process of gradually reducing the value of an [[Intangible Asset]] or the outstanding balance of a loan over a specific period of time. In finance and accounting, amortization serves two primary purposes:

1.  **[[Intangible Asset Amortization]]**: Allocating the cost of intangible assets, such as patents, trademarks, or goodwill, over their useful life, to reflect their gradual decline in value and match the expense recognition with the period in which the asset generates economic benefits.
2.  **[[Loan Amortization]]**: Distributing loan repayments over time, so that each payment covers both principal and interest, resulting in a progressively decreasing loan balance and eventually paying off the loan in full by the end of its term.

## [[Intangible Asset Amortization]]

Intangible assets are non-physical assets that provide economic benefits to a company over an extended period of time. Examples include [[Patent]]s, [[Copyright]]s, [[Trademark]]s, and [[Goodwill]]. To account for the decline in value of [[Intangible Asset]]s over time, companies use the process of amortization.

### Amortization Methods

1.  **[[Straight-Line Amortization]]**: The most common method of amortizing intangible assets, in which the cost of the asset is divided equally over its useful life, resulting in a consistent annual amortization expense. The formula for straight-line amortization is:
    
    [[Amortization Expense]] = ([[Cost of Intangible Asset]] - [[Residual Value]]) / [[Useful Life]]
    
2.  **[[Accelerated Amortization]]**: Allocates a higher proportion of the asset's cost to the earlier years of its useful life, resulting in a higher amortization expense in the initial years and a lower expense in later years. One example of accelerated amortization is the double-declining balance method.
    

## Loan Amortization

Loan amortization refers to the process of paying off a loan through a series of regular payments that include both principal and interest. This method allows borrowers to reduce their loan balance over time, eventually eliminating the debt at the end of the loan term.

### Amortization Schedule

An amortization schedule is a table that outlines the allocation of loan payments between principal and interest over the life of the loan. It shows the starting loan balance, the amount of each payment that goes toward principal and interest, and the remaining loan balance after each payment.

### Loan Amortization Factors

1.  **[[Loan Amount]]**: The initial amount borrowed.
2.  **[[Interest Rate]]**: The annual percentage rate (APR) applied to the loan balance.
3.  **[[Loan Term]]**: The length of time over which the loan will be repaid, typically expressed in months or years.
4.  **[[Payment Frequency]]**: The number of payments made per year, such as monthly, quarterly, or annually.

## Relationship to [[Depreciation]]

Amortization is similar to depreciation, as both processes involve allocating the cost of an asset over its useful life. However, amortization applies to intangible assets, while depreciation applies to tangible assets, such as buildings, machinery, and equipment.
