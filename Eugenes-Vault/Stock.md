## Overview

A stock, also known as a share, is a unit of ownership in a corporation or company. By purchasing stocks, investors become part-owners of the company, with their ownership stake proportional to the number of shares they hold. Stocks represent a claim on a company's earnings and assets and can be bought, sold, or traded on stock exchanges and other trading platforms.

## Types of Stocks

There are two main types of stocks:

1.  **Common stocks**: These stocks grant shareholders voting rights and the right to receive dividends. However, common shareholders have the lowest priority claim on the company's assets in case of bankruptcy or liquidation.
    
2.  **Preferred stocks**: These stocks typically do not grant voting rights but give shareholders a higher claim on the company's assets and profits compared to common shareholders. Preferred shareholders receive a fixed dividend before common shareholders and have priority during liquidation.
    

## Stock Valuation

The value of a stock depends on various factors, including the company's financial performance, market demand, and investor sentiment. There are two main methods of valuing stocks:

1.  **Fundamental analysis**: This method involves analyzing the company's financial statements, management team, industry trends, and other factors to determine the company's intrinsic value. Investors compare this intrinsic value to the market price to decide whether the stock is undervalued or overvalued.
    
2.  **Technical analysis**: This method involves studying historical price and volume data to identify trends and patterns that may predict future stock price movements. Technical analysts focus on chart patterns, indicators, and other tools to make their investment decisions.
    

## [[Stock Trading]]

Stocks can be traded on stock exchanges, over-the-counter (OTC) markets, or alternative trading systems. Investors can buy and sell stocks through brokers, who act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. Some common types of stock orders include:

-   Market orders: Orders to buy or sell a stock immediately at the best available price
-   Limit orders: Orders to buy or sell a stock at a specified price or better
-   Stop orders: Orders to buy or sell a stock when it reaches a specified price

## Stock Indices

A stock index is a statistical measure that reflects the performance of a group of stocks. Some well-known stock indices include:

-   Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)
-   Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500)
-   NASDAQ Composite Index
-   FTSE 100 Index

## Risks Associated with Stocks

Investing in stocks carries certain risks, such as:

-   Market risk: The value of stocks may decline due to fluctuations in the stock market.
-   Company risk: The company may perform poorly or go bankrupt, leading to a decrease in the value of the stock or a complete loss of the investment.
-   Liquidity risk: The investor may have difficulty selling the stock at the desired price and time due to low trading volume or market conditions.
