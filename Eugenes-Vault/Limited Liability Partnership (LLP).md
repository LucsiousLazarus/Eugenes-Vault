## Overview

A Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is a type of partnership that provides limited liability protection to all of its partners. This business structure combines the flexibility and pass-through taxation of a partnership with the limited liability benefits of a corporation. LLPs are commonly used by professional service firms, such as law firms, accounting firms, and architectural practices.

## Key Characteristics

1.  **Formation**: An LLP is typically formed by registering with the appropriate state agency and filing a statement of qualification or a similar document. A written partnership agreement should also be created, outlining the roles, responsibilities, and financial contributions of the partners.
    
2.  **Ownership and Management**: In an LLP, ownership and management are shared among the partners. Each partner contributes capital, labor, or expertise to the business and has equal decision-making authority, unless otherwise specified in the partnership agreement.
    
3.  **Taxation**: Like a General Partnership, an LLP is not a separate tax entity, which means that profits and losses are "passed through" to the partners and taxed at their individual tax rates. This can be advantageous for some business owners, as it avoids the double taxation that can occur with corporations.
    
4.  **Liability**: In an LLP, partners have limited liability protection, meaning they are not personally responsible for the partnership's debts and obligations. Their personal assets are protected from the partnership's liabilities, similar to shareholders in a corporation.

## Dissolution

An LLP can be dissolved under several circumstances, including the withdrawal or death of a partner, the completion of a specific project, or the mutual agreement of all partners. Upon dissolution, the partnership's assets are distributed among the partners according to their ownership interests, after paying off the partnership's debts and obligations.
