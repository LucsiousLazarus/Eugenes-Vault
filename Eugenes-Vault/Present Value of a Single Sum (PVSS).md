## Overview

The Present Value of a Single Sum (PVSS) is the current value of a future sum of money, taking into account the time value of money. It is a crucial concept in finance and investing, helping to determine the present value of investments, loans, or any future cash flow. PVSS is calculated by discounting the future sum using a specific interest rate.

## Formula

The formula for calculating the present value of a single sum is:

PVSS = FV / (1 + r)^t

-   PVSS: present value of the single sum
-   FV: future value of the single sum
-   r: interest rate (in decimal) per period
-   t: total number of periods

## Example

Suppose an investor wants to determine the present value of receiving $10,000 in 3 years, with a discount rate of 6% per year. Using the PVSS formula:

PVSS = $10,000 / (1 + 0.06)^3 PVSS â‰ˆ $8,394.93

The present value of the $10,000 sum after 3 years is approximately $8,394.93.

## Applications

1.  **Investment Evaluation**: PVSS can be used to evaluate the present value of investments that generate a single cash flow in the future, such as bonds or one-time dividends.
2.  **Loan Evaluation**: PVSS can be used to determine the present value of a loan's future cash flows, helping borrowers and lenders to assess the cost and benefit of loans.
3.  **Financial Planning**: PVSS can be used to estimate the present value of a future expense or goal, assisting in making informed decisions and budgeting.
