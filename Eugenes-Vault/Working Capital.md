## Overview

Working capital, also known as net working capital (NWC), is a measure of a company's short-term financial health and operational efficiency. It represents the difference between a company's current assets and current liabilities. Working capital is an essential component of a business's day-to-day operations, as it provides the funds needed to cover ongoing expenses, such as payroll, inventory, and accounts payable, as well as to invest in growth opportunities, such as expanding production capacity or launching new products.

## Calculation

Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

### Current Assets

Current assets are short-term assets that can be converted into cash or used to generate cash within one year, including:

1.  **Cash and Cash Equivalents**: Cash on hand, bank deposits, and highly liquid short-term investments, such as money market funds or treasury bills.
2.  **Accounts Receivable**: Money owed to a company by its customers for goods or services provided on credit.
3.  **Inventory**: Raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods that are held for sale or used in the production process.
4.  **Prepaid Expenses**: Expenses that have been paid in advance, such as insurance premiums or rent, which will be recognized as expenses over time.

### Current Liabilities

Current liabilities are short-term obligations that must be settled within one year, including:

1.  **Accounts Payable**: Money owed by a company to its suppliers or vendors for goods or services received on credit.
2.  **Short-Term Debt**: Debt obligations that are due within one year, such as bank loans, lines of credit, or commercial paper.
3.  **Accrued Expenses**: Expenses that have been incurred but not yet paid, such as wages, taxes, or interest.
4.  **Deferred Revenue**: Money received in advance for goods or services that will be delivered or performed in the future.

## Importance of Working Capital

1.  **Liquidity**: A positive working capital indicates that a company has sufficient liquid assets to cover its short-term obligations, reducing the risk of default or bankruptcy.
2.  **Operational Efficiency**: Effective management of working capital can help to improve a company's cash conversion cycle, inventory turnover, and accounts receivable turnover, leading to increased efficiency and profitability.
3.  **Growth Opportunities**: Adequate working capital allows a company to take advantage of growth opportunities, such as entering new markets, investing in research and development, or acquiring assets at favorable prices.

## Working Capital Management

Working capital management involves optimizing a company's current assets and current liabilities to ensure adequate liquidity, minimize financing costs, and maximize operational efficiency. Key strategies for working capital management include:

1.  **Cash Management**: Monitoring and forecasting cash inflows and outflows, to maintain sufficient cash balances, avoid overdrafts, and optimize the use of excess cash.
2.  **Accounts Receivable Management**: Implementing credit policies, collection procedures, and invoicing practices, to minimize the risk of bad debts and accelerate the collection of receivables.
3.  **Inventory Management**: Balancing the costs of holding inventory, such as storage, obsolescence, and spoilage, with the benefits of meeting customer demand, reducing lead times, and taking advantage of quantity discounts.
4.  **Accounts Payable Management**: Negotiating favorable payment terms with suppliers, taking advantage of early payment discounts, and managing the timing of payments, to maximize the use of trade credit and minimize the cost of short-term financing.
