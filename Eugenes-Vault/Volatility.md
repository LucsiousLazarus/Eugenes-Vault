## Overview

[[Volatility]] is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. It represents the degree of variation of a trading price series over time, with higher volatility indicating that the price of an asset can change dramatically over a short time period in either direction.

## Types of Volatility

1. **Historical Volatility**: Also known as statistical volatility, refers to the realized volatility of a financial instrument over a specified period of time. It measures the standard deviation of the asset's returns.
    
2. **Implied Volatility**: It is the estimated volatility of a security's price derived from its options. It is implied by the market's option prices.
    

## Volatility in Different Markets

- **Equity Market**: High volatility usually implies increased risk, which translates to uncertain stock prices. During periods of high volatility, the risk is considered higher.
    
- **Options Market**: In the world of options, volatility plays a pivotal role. [[Option Premium]] is majorly driven by implied volatility. Higher volatility usually translates to higher options prices.
    
- **Foreign Exchange Market**: Currency volatility is measured by looking at the fluctuations in price in a currency pair.
    

## Key Measures of Volatility

- **Volatility Index (VIX)**: A real-time market index representing the market's expectation of 30-day forward-looking volatility, derived from the price inputs of the S&P 500 index options.
    
- **Average True Range (ATR)**: A technical analysis indicator that measures market volatility by decomposing the entire range of an asset price for that period.
    
- **Beta**: It measures the volatility of an individual stock in comparison to the unsystematic risk of the entire market.
