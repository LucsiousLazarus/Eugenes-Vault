## Overview

A balance sheet is a [[Financial Statement]] that provides a snapshot of a [[Company]]'s financial position at a specific point in time. It lists the company's assets, liabilities, and equity, allowing users to assess its financial health, [[Liquidity]], and [[Solvency]]. The balance sheet adheres to the accounting equation:

[[Asset]]s = [[Liabilities]] + [[Equity]]

## Components of a Balance Sheet

### [[Asset]]s

Assets are resources owned or controlled by a company that have future economic value. They can be tangible (physical) or intangible (non-physical) and are typically classified into two categories:

1.  **[[Current Asset]]s**: [[Asset]]s that are expected to be converted into [[Cash]], sold, or consumed within one year or the [[Company]]'s [[Operating Cycle]], whichever is longer. Examples include [[Cash]], [[Accounts Receivable]], [[Inventory]], and [[Short-Term Investment]]s.
    
2.  **[[Non-Current Asset]]s**: [[Asset]]s that have a longer [[Useful Life]] and are not expected to be converted into [[Cash]] or consumed within one year or the [[Company]]'s [[Operating Cycle]]. Examples include [[Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE)]], [[Long-Term Investment]]s, and [[Intangible Asset]]s like [[Patent]]s and [[Trademark]]s.
    

### [[Liabilities]]

Liabilities are obligations a company owes to others and are expected to be settled by transferring assets or providing services. Like assets, liabilities are classified into two categories:

1.  **Current Liabilities**: Obligations that are expected to be settled within one year or the company's operating cycle, whichever is longer. Examples include accounts payable, accrued expenses, and short-term debt.
    
2.  **Non-Current Liabilities**: Obligations that are not expected to be settled within one year or the company's operating cycle. Examples include long-term debt, deferred tax liabilities, and pension obligations.
    

### Equity

Equity, also known as shareholders' equity or owners' equity, represents the residual interest in the company's assets after deducting liabilities. It consists of:

1.  **Paid-in Capital**: The amount of money invested by shareholders in exchange for shares of the company's stock. This includes common stock and preferred stock.
    
2.  **Retained Earnings**: The cumulative earnings of the company that have not been distributed to shareholders as dividends. Retained earnings can be used to reinvest in the business, pay down debt, or distribute future dividends.
    
3.  **Treasury Stock**: Shares of the company's stock that have been repurchased by the company and held in its treasury. Treasury stock reduces shareholders' equity.
    
4.  **Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI)**: Unrealized gains and losses from certain items that are not included in the calculation of net income, such as foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities.
    

## Analyzing a Balance Sheet

The balance sheet is an essential tool for analyzing a company's financial health. Key balance sheet ratios include:

1.  **Current Ratio**: Measures a company's ability to pay its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets. It is calculated as Current Assets / Current Liabilities.
    
2.  **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: Measures the proportion of debt a company uses to finance its assets relative to its equity. It is calculated as Total Liabilities / Shareholders' Equity.
    
3.  **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Measures the profitability of a company relative to its shareholders' equity. It is calculated as Net Income / Shareholders' Equity.
    
4.  **Asset Turnover**: Measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales. It is calculated as Net Sales / Average Total Assets.
