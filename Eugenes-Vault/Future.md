## Overview

A [[Future]], also known as a futures contract, is a legal agreement to buy or sell a particular commodity or asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. Futures contracts are standardized for quality and quantity to facilitate trading on a futures exchange.

## Components of a Futures Contract

A futures contract includes the following information:

1. **Underlying Asset:** This could be a physical commodity (such as gold, oil, or wheat) or a financial instrument (such as a stock or bond).
    
2. **Contract Size:** This specifies the amount of the underlying asset that is to be delivered.
    
3. **Price:** The agreed-upon price at which the asset will be delivered in the future.
    
4. **Delivery Date:** The specific date in the future when the asset will be delivered.
    
5. **Settlement:** Futures contracts can be settled by physical delivery (actual physical commodities are handed over) or by cash settlement (the difference in the spot price and the agreed-upon price is paid).
    

## Trading Futures

Futures contracts are used by two categories of market participants:

- **Hedgers:** They use futures to reduce the risk of price changes in the asset. For instance, a farmer may use futures to lock in a price for his produce, reducing the risk of price fluctuations.
    
- **Speculators:** They hope to profit from changes in the price of the futures contract. Speculators, such as day traders, do not intend to take delivery but rather offset their positions before contract expiry.
    

## Risks and Benefits

Futures contracts can provide a number of benefits including leverage, price transparency, hedging, and the ability to profit from falling prices. However, they also carry risks such as market risk, leverage risk, and liquidity risk.

## Role in the Economy

Futures markets play important roles in the overall economy. They allow for price discovery, where market participants determine the price of commodities and financial instruments through supply and demand. They also provide opportunities for risk management, as businesses can hedge against potential losses from price fluctuations.
