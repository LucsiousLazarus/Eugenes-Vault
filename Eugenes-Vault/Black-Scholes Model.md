## Overview

The [[Black-Scholes Model]], also known as the Black-Scholes-Merton model, is a mathematical model used for pricing options and derivatives. Developed by economists Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton, it plays a crucial role in financial markets.

## The Black-Scholes Formula

The Black-Scholes model provides a formula for calculating the theoretical price of European call and put options, which are only exercisable at expiration.

The formula for a call option is:

C = S0e^-qt * N(d1) - Xe^-rt * N(d2)

And for a put option:

P = Xe^-rt * N(-d2) - S0e^-qt * N(-d1)

Where:

- C = Call option price
- P = Put option price
- S = Current price of the underlying
- X = Strike price of the option
- r = Risk-free interest rate
- q = Dividend yield
- t = Time to expiration
- N = A normal distribution
- e = The base of the natural log (~2.71828)

## Assumptions

The Black-Scholes Model makes several assumptions, some of which have been criticized:

1. **European Options**: The model applies to European options that can only be exercised at expiration.
2. **No Dividends**: The model assumes that the underlying asset does not pay dividends during the life of the option.
3. **Efficient Markets**: The model assumes markets are efficient.
4. **No Transaction Costs**: The model assumes no transaction or commission costs.
5. **Risk-Free Interest Rate**: The model assumes the risk-free interest rate is constant and known.
6. **Normal Distribution**: The model assumes returns on the underlying are normally distributed.
7. **Lognormal Asset Prices**: It assumes that asset prices are lognormally distributed.

## Applications

The Black-Scholes Model is widely used by options traders and has also been applied to other areas of finance including risk management and strategy testing.
