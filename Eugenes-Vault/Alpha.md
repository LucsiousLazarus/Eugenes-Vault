## Overview

[[Alpha]] is a measure of the active return on an investment, gauging the performance of an investment against a market index or benchmark that is considered to represent the market’s movement as a whole. The excess return of the investment relative to the return of the benchmark index is its alpha.

## Calculation of Alpha

Alpha is often used in conjunction with beta (the overall market's contribution to a stock's return), which measures the broad market's influence on an individual asset. The formula for calculating alpha is:

Alpha = Investment Return - [(Risk-Free Rate + Beta * (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate)]

## Applications of Alpha

- **Performance Measure**: Alpha measures an investment’s performance on a risk-adjusted basis. A positive alpha of 1.0 means the investment's return on investment over a selected period of time was 1% better than the market during that same period.
- **Active Portfolio Management**: Alpha is a tool for active portfolio managers who seek to outperform the broad market. Fund managers who employ an active strategy aim to generate alpha.
- **Risk and Reward**: While a high alpha is always desirable from a return standpoint, it is crucial to remember that a high alpha often implies higher risk.

## The Limitations of Alpha

- Alpha is a historical measure and may not predict future performance.
- It depends on the accuracy of beta (systematic risk) calculations, which can vary depending on the time period used.
- Alpha can sometimes be skewed due to incorrect assumptions.
