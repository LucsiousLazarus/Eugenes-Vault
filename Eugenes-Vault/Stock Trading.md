## Overview

Stock trading is the act of buying, selling, or exchanging stocks (also known as shares) of publicly traded companies. It allows investors to buy a portion of ownership in a company, with the goal of profiting from capital appreciation, dividend payments, or both. Stock trading occurs on stock exchanges, over-the-counter (OTC) markets, and other trading platforms.

## Trading Platforms

Stock trading can be executed on various platforms, including:

1.  **Stock exchanges**: These are regulated marketplaces where stocks are listed, and transactions are facilitated. Examples include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ.
    
2.  **Over-the-counter (OTC) markets**: These are decentralized marketplaces where stocks are traded directly between buyers and sellers, without a central exchange. OTC trading typically involves smaller companies that do not meet the listing requirements of major stock exchanges.
    
3.  **Alternative trading systems (ATS)**: These are private, non-exchange trading venues that match buyers and sellers of securities. ATSs may cater to institutional investors or focus on specific asset classes, such as dark pools.
    

## Trading Strategies

There are various stock trading strategies that investors employ, including:

1.  **Day trading**: The buying and selling of stocks within the same trading day, with the goal of capitalizing on short-term price movements.
    
2.  **Swing trading**: The buying and selling of stocks over a period of days to weeks, aiming to profit from short-term price fluctuations.
    
3.  **Position trading**: The buying and holding of stocks for several weeks to months, or even years, with the goal of profiting from longer-term trends.
    
4.  **Value investing**: The practice of buying undervalued stocks with strong fundamentals, based on the belief that their intrinsic value will be recognized by the market over time.
    
5.  **Growth investing**: The strategy of investing in companies with high growth potential, expecting that their stock prices will appreciate significantly as the companies grow.
    

## Types of Stock Orders

Investors can place various types of orders to execute their stock trades, including:

1.  **Market orders**: Orders to buy or sell a stock immediately at the best available price.
    
2.  **Limit orders**: Orders to buy or sell a stock at a specified price or better.
    
3.  **Stop orders**: Orders to buy or sell a stock when it reaches a specified price.
    
4.  **Stop-limit orders**: A combination of a stop order and a limit order, triggered when the stock reaches a specified price and executed within a specified price range.
    

## Risks Associated with Stock Trading

Stock trading carries several risks, such as:

1.  **Market risk**: The value of stocks may decline due to fluctuations in the stock market.
    
2.  **Company risk**: The company may perform poorly or go bankrupt, leading to a decrease in the value of the stock or a complete loss of the investment.
    
3.  **Liquidity risk**: The investor may have difficulty selling the stock at the desired price and time due to low trading volume or market conditions.
    
4.  **Leverage risk**: Using leverage (borrowed money) to trade stocks can amplify gains but also magnify losses, potentially leading to significant financial losses.
