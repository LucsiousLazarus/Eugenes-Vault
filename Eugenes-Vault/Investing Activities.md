## Overview

Investing activities are related to the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents. These are actions that have the potential to generate future income and cash flows. Investing activities are a critical part of a company's strategic planning for growth and diversification.

In financial reporting, the cash flow from investing activities section on the [[Cash Flow Statement (CFS)]] shows how much the company invested or divested during a particular period.

## Examples of Investing Activities

Investing activities generally include:

1.  **Purchase of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE)**: This could include the purchase of new equipment, buildings, land, or vehicles.
    
2.  **Sale of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE)**: When a company sells its long-term assets, it will also be considered an investing activity.
    
3.  **Investments in Other Companies**: This could include purchasing equity or debt securities of other corporations.
    
4.  **Sales of Investments**: When a company sells its investments in other companies.
    

## Importance of Investing Activities

Investing activities are crucial for the long-term success and growth of a company. They reflect a company's strategic decisions to invest in assets for generating future revenue. Negative cash flow from investing activities is not always a bad sign if the company is investing heavily for future growth.

On the other hand, a company that is divesting its assets more than investing could be in distress. Therefore, careful analysis of investing activities and understanding the context is essential.
