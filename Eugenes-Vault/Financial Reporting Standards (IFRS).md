## Overview

International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are a set of accounting standards developed by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to provide a global framework for the preparation and presentation of financial statements. IFRS aims to enhance the comparability, transparency, and reliability of financial information across different countries and jurisdictions. Companies operating in countries that have adopted IFRS are required to prepare their financial statements in accordance with these standards.

IFRS is an alternative to other accounting standards, such as the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) used in the United States. The adoption of IFRS has grown significantly in recent years, with more than 140 countries now using or allowing the use of IFRS in their jurisdictions.

## Key Features of IFRS

1.  **Principle-based:** IFRS is based on a set of principles that provide a broad framework for financial reporting, rather than specific rules. This approach allows for greater flexibility and judgment in the application of IFRS, but it may also result in differences in interpretation and implementation.
    
2.  **Fair presentation:** IFRS requires that financial statements present a fair and accurate view of a company's financial position, performance, and cash flows. This involves the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies, as well as the use of reasonable estimates and judgments.
    
3.  **Comparability:** One of the main objectives of IFRS is to enhance the comparability of financial information across different countries and jurisdictions. To achieve this, IFRS establishes common accounting standards and practices for the presentation of financial statements.
    
4.  **Transparency:** IFRS promotes transparency by requiring the disclosure of relevant and material information about a company's financial position, performance, and cash flows. This includes information about a company's accounting policies, estimates, and judgments, as well as the nature and extent of its risks and uncertainties.
    
5.  **Consistency:** IFRS requires that companies apply their accounting policies consistently from one period to another, unless a change in policy is justified and properly accounted for. This helps to ensure that financial information is consistent and comparable over time.

## Adoption of IFRS

The adoption of IFRS varies across different countries and jurisdictions, with some requiring the use of IFRS for all companies, while others allowing the use of IFRS as an alternative to their local accounting standards. In some cases, countries have adopted IFRS with certain modifications or exceptions to address specific local requirements or circumstances.

In the United States, public companies are required to use the US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for their financial reporting, but the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been considering the potential adoption of IFRS or allowing US companies to choose between IFRS and GAAP.
