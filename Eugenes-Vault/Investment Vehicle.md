## Overview

An [[Investment Vehicle]] is a product used by investors with the intention of gaining positive returns. Investment vehicles can be low-risk, like bonds and certificates of deposit (CDs), or they can carry a high degree of risk, like futures and options. Investment vehicles can also include more exotic investments like limited partnerships, derivatives, or real estate investment trusts (REITs).

## Types of Investment Vehicles

Here are some common types of investment vehicles:

1. **Stocks:** Ownership shares in a corporation. They represent a claim on part of the corporation's assets and earnings.
    
2. **Bonds:** Debt security, under which the issuer owes the holder a debt and is obliged to pay them interest or to repay the principal at a later date.
    
3. **Mutual Funds:** Investment funds managed by professionals, which pool money from many investors to purchase securities.
    
4. **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs):** Similar to mutual funds, but they trade like a stock on an exchange.
    
5. **Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs):** Companies that own, operate, or finance income-generating real estate.
    
6. **Derivatives:** Financial contracts whose value is linked to the value of an underlying asset. They include options, futures, and swaps.
    
7. **Cryptocurrencies:** Digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security. The most famous one is Bitcoin.
    

## Considerations for Choosing an Investment Vehicle

Different investment vehicles suit different investors based on their risk tolerance, investment horizon, and investment goals. Therefore, factors such as the following should be considered:

1. **Risk tolerance:** How much risk an investor is willing to take on can determine what investment vehicles are most suitable.
    
2. **Investment horizon:** The length of time an investor plans to hold an investment can also determine which vehicle to choose.
    
3. **Investment goals:** What the investor hopes to achieve (e.g., capital appreciation, income generation, preservation of capital) can inform the choice of investment vehicle.
    
4. **Diversification:** To spread out risk, investors typically diversify their investments across various investment vehicles.
