## Overview

A Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) is a publicly traded [[Shell Company]] created to acquire or merge with an existing private company, allowing the target company to become public without going through the traditional [[Initial Public Offering (IPO)]] process. SPACs have become increasingly popular in recent years as an alternative method for private companies to access [[Public Capital Market]]s.

## Formation and Funding

SPACs are typically formed by experienced [[Investor]]s or [[Business]] [[Executive]]s, known as sponsors, who possess industry knowledge and a network of contacts to identify and acquire a suitable target [[Company]]. Sponsors create a SPAC by raising funds through an [[Initial Public Offering (IPO)]], during which investors purchase units that generally consist of one [[Share]] of common [[Stock]] and a fraction of a [[Warrant]]. The funds raised are placed in an [[Escrow]] account and can only be used to complete a business combination or to return capital to investors if the SPAC fails to identify a suitable target within a specified timeframe, typically 18-24 months.

## Target [[Acquisition]] and [[Merger]] Process

After raising funds, the SPAC's management team searches for a suitable [[Private Company]] to acquire or merge with. Once a target is identified, the SPAC negotiates the terms of the [[Business]] combination, which are then subject to approval by the SPAC's [[Shareholder]]s. If the [[Shareholder]]s approve the transaction, the SPAC and the target company merge, with the combined entity becoming a [[Publicly Traded Company]].

During this process, the target [[Company]] typically undergoes extensive financial and operational due diligence, similar to the scrutiny faced by companies in a traditional IPO. However, the overall timeline for completing a business combination through a SPAC is usually shorter than a traditional IPO process.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of SPACs

Advantages:

-   Faster and more efficient route to becoming a [[Publicly Traded Company]] for target companies
-   Reduced regulatory and disclosure requirements compared to traditional IPOs
-   Flexibility in negotiating deal terms and valuation
-   Access to experienced management team and network of the SPAC sponsors

Disadvantages:

-   Limited time to identify and complete a business combination
-   Potential conflicts of interest between SPAC sponsors and [[Shareholder]]s
-   Dilution of ownership for target [[Company]] [[Shareholder]]s due to the issuance of [[Share]]s to the SPAC sponsors
-   The possibility of the deal falling through if the SPAC [[Shareholder]]s reject the business combination
