## Overview

A partnership is a business structure in which two or more individuals or organizations come together to share ownership, management responsibilities, and profits or losses. Partnerships can be formed for various purposes, including pooling resources, sharing risks, or leveraging complementary skills and expertise. Partnerships are generally easier to establish and maintain than corporations, but they do not offer the same level of limited liability protection.

## Key Characteristics

1.  **Formation**: Partnerships can be relatively easy to form, often requiring only a written or verbal agreement between the partners. However, it is advisable to create a formal partnership agreement outlining the partners' roles, responsibilities, and financial contributions to avoid future disputes.
    
2.  **Ownership and Management**: In a partnership, ownership and management are typically shared among the partners, with each partner contributing capital, labor, or expertise to the business. Decision-making authority can be divided equally or allocated based on each partner's contribution or expertise.
    
3.  **Taxation**: Partnerships are not separate tax entities, which means that profits and losses are "passed through" to the partners and taxed at their individual tax rates. This can be advantageous for some business owners, as it avoids the double taxation that can occur with corporations.
    
4.  **Liability**: In a general partnership, partners are personally responsible for the partnership's debts and obligations, meaning their personal assets can be at risk in the event of a lawsuit or financial difficulty. However, there are other types of partnerships, such as limited partnerships and limited liability partnerships, that offer varying degrees of liability protection.
    

## Types of Partnerships

1.  **[[General Partnership (GP)]]**: A partnership in which all partners share in the management responsibilities and are personally liable for the partnership's debts and obligations. Each partner is considered an agent of the partnership and can bind the partnership in contracts and agreements.
    
2.  **[[Limited Partnership (LP)]]**: A partnership that includes both general partners, who manage the business and are personally liable for its debts, and limited partners, who contribute capital but have limited liability and do not participate in management. Limited partners' liability is generally limited to the amount of their capital contribution.
    
3.  **[[Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)]]**: A partnership structure that offers limited liability protection to all partners. In an LLP, partners are not personally liable for the partnership's debts or the actions of other partners. LLPs are commonly used by professional service firms, such as law firms and accounting firms.
