## Overview

Useful life refers to the estimated period that an asset, such as property, plant, and equipment (PPE) or intangible assets, is expected to be functional and contribute to a company's revenue-generating activities. Determining the useful life of an asset is essential for accounting purposes, as it helps allocate the cost of the asset over its expected useful life using depreciation or amortization methods.

## Factors Affecting Useful Life

Several factors can affect the useful life of an asset, including:

1.  **Physical wear and tear**: The natural deterioration of an asset due to usage, environmental conditions, or the passage of time.
2.  **Technological obsolescence**: The risk that an asset becomes outdated or less efficient due to advancements in technology.
3.  **Legal and regulatory constraints**: Changes in laws or regulations that may limit or restrict the usage of an asset.
4.  **Economic factors**: Market conditions or other economic factors that may impact the demand for an asset or the products and services it supports.

## Estimating Useful Life

Estimating the useful life of an asset requires management judgment and consideration of various factors. Some common methods for estimating useful life include:

1.  **Industry guidelines**: Many industries have established guidelines for the useful lives of common assets, which can be a helpful starting point.
2.  **Historical data**: Companies can analyze the useful lives of similar assets within their organization to estimate the useful life of a new asset.
3.  **Manufacturer recommendations**: Some manufacturers provide guidance on the expected useful life of their products.

## [[Depreciation]] and [[Amortization]]

Assets are systematically allocated their cost over their useful life using depreciation (for tangible assets like PPE) or amortization (for intangible assets like patents or trademarks). There are several methods for calculating depreciation and amortization, including:

1.  **Straight-Line Method**: Allocates an equal amount of depreciation or amortization expense for each year of the asset's useful life.
2.  **Double-Declining Balance Method**: Accelerated depreciation or amortization method that allocates higher expenses in the early years of an asset's life and lower expenses in later years.
3.  **Units of Production Method**: Depreciation or amortization expense is based on the actual usage or production volume of the asset.

## Revising Useful Life Estimates

If there are significant changes in the factors affecting an asset's useful life, companies may need to revise their useful life estimates. A change in the useful life estimate is accounted for prospectively, meaning that the remaining depreciable or amortizable amount is allocated over the revised remaining useful life.
