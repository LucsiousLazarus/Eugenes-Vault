## Overview

A share, also known as a [[Stock]], is a unit of ownership in a company or corporation. When a company issues shares to raise capital, investors can purchase these shares to become part-owners of the company. The total number of outstanding shares represents the company's equity, and the value of each share depends on the company's financial performance and market demand.

## Types of Shares

There are two main types of shares:

1.  **Common shares**: These shares grant the shareholder voting rights and the right to receive dividends. However, common shareholders have the lowest priority claim on the company's assets in case of bankruptcy or liquidation.
    
2.  **Preferred shares**: These shares generally do not grant voting rights but give the shareholder a higher claim on the company's assets and profits compared to common shareholders. Preferred shareholders receive a fixed dividend before common shareholders and have priority during liquidation.
    

## Valuation of Shares

The value of a share is determined by various factors, including the company's financial performance, market demand, and investor sentiment. There are two main methods of valuing shares:

1.  **Fundamental analysis**: This method involves analyzing the company's financial statements, management team, industry trends, and other factors to determine the company's intrinsic value. Investors compare this intrinsic value to the market price to decide whether the share is undervalued or overvalued.
    
2.  **Technical analysis**: This method involves studying historical price and volume data to identify trends and patterns that may predict future share price movements. Technical analysts focus on chart patterns, indicators, and other tools to make their investment decisions.
    

## Shareholder Rights

Owning shares in a company grants the shareholder certain rights, which may vary depending on the type of shares and the company's bylaws. Some common shareholder rights include:

-   Voting rights on major company decisions
-   The right to receive dividends when declared by the company
-   The right to inspect the company's books and records
-   The right to participate in annual general meetings (AGMs)
-   The right to sue the company for wrongful acts or mismanagement
-   The right to share in the distribution of the company's assets upon liquidation

## Share Issuance and Trading

Shares can be issued through an initial public offering (IPO) when a company decides to go public and list its shares on a stock exchange. After the IPO, shares can be bought and sold on the secondary market through stock exchanges, over-the-counter markets, or alternative trading systems.

## Risks Associated with Shares

Investing in shares carries certain risks, such as:

-   Market risk: The value of shares may decline due to fluctuations in the stock market.
-   Company risk: The company may perform poorly or go bankrupt, leading to a decrease in the value of the shares or a complete loss of the investment.
-   Dilution risk: The issuance of additional shares may dilute the value of existing shares.
