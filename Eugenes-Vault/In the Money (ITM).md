## Overview

In the Money (ITM) is a term used in options trading to describe an option contract that has intrinsic value. An option is considered ITM when the strike price of the option is favorable compared to the current market price of the underlying asset. ITM options are more likely to be exercised, as they allow the option holder to buy or sell the underlying asset at a better price than the market offers.

## Call Options

A call option is ITM when the strike price is below the current market price of the underlying asset. In this situation, the option holder can exercise the option to buy the asset at a lower price than the market value, resulting in an immediate profit.

**Example**: An investor holds a call option on Company XYZ with a strike price of $50. If the current market price of Company XYZ's stock is $55, the call option is ITM.

## Put Options

A put option is ITM when the strike price is above the current market price of the underlying asset. In this case, the option holder can exercise the option to sell the asset at a higher price than the market value, generating a profit.

**Example**: An investor holds a put option on Company XYZ with a strike price of $50. If the current market price of Company XYZ's stock is $45, the put option is ITM.

## Intrinsic Value

The intrinsic value of an ITM option is the difference between the strike price and the current market price of the underlying asset. The intrinsic value of a call option is calculated as the current market price minus the strike price, while for a put option, it is the strike price minus the current market price.

## Relationship with Time Value

As an option moves further into the money, its intrinsic value increases. However, the time value of an option decreases as it gets closer to the expiration date. Therefore, ITM options typically have a higher intrinsic value and lower time value compared to out-of-the-money (OTM) or at-the-money (ATM) options.

## Trading Implications

ITM options tend to have higher premiums due to their intrinsic value. However, they also have a higher delta, meaning their price is more sensitive to changes in the underlying asset's price. Traders and investors often use ITM options for various strategies, including hedging, speculation, or income generation.
