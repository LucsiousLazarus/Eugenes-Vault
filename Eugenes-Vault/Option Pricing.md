## Overview

[[Option Pricing]] refers to the process of determining the fair value or theoretical price of an options contract. An option is a type of financial derivative that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset at a specified price (strike price) on or before a specific date (expiration date).

## Key Components of Option Pricing

1. **Underlying Asset's Price:** The current market price of the asset that the option contract is based on. It is the main determinant of an option's price.
    
2. **Strike Price:** The predetermined price at which the option holder can buy or sell the underlying asset.
    
3. **Time to Expiration:** The time remaining until the option contract expires. Options with more time until expiration are more valuable because they offer more opportunity for the underlying asset's price to move favorably.
    
4. **Volatility:** The degree of price fluctuations in the underlying asset. Higher volatility increases the potential for larger price swings, making the option more valuable.
    
5. **Risk-free Interest Rate:** The interest rate on a risk-free investment, usually a government bond. Higher interest rates increase the cost of holding an option.
    

## Option Pricing Models

There are several models used for option pricing, including:

1. **Black-Scholes Model:** The most famous and widely used model. It assumes a lognormal distribution of asset prices with constant volatility and interest rates.
    
2. **Binomial Option Pricing Model:** This model uses a discrete-time model of the varying price over time of the underlying asset.
    
3. **Monte Carlo Simulation:** This technique uses random sampling and statistical modeling to estimate mathematical functions and simulate the price movements of the underlying asset.
    

## Limitations of Option Pricing Models

Despite their sophistication, option pricing models have limitations. They rely on certain assumptions that may not hold in the real world. For example, they typically assume constant volatility and risk-free rates, no transaction costs or taxes, and the ability to trade in fractional shares.
