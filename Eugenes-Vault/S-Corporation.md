## Overview

An S-Corporation (S-Corp) is a type of corporation in the United States that allows for pass-through taxation, similar to partnerships and limited liability companies (LLCs). S-Corps enjoy the limited liability protection of a corporation while avoiding double taxation, as income, deductions, and credits flow through to shareholders for federal tax purposes.

## Key Features

1.  **Limited Liability**: Shareholders' personal assets are protected from the corporation's debts and liabilities.
2.  **Separate Legal Entity**: An S-Corp is a separate legal entity from its owners, allowing it to enter into contracts, own property, and sue or be sued.
3.  **Perpetual Existence**: An S-Corp can continue indefinitely, regardless of changes in ownership.
4.  **Pass-through Taxation**: S-Corps avoid double taxation as income and losses flow through to shareholders, who report them on their individual tax returns.
5.  **Ownership Restrictions**: S-Corps can have no more than 100 shareholders, and they must be U.S. citizens or residents.

## Formation Process

To form an S-Corporation, the following steps must be taken:

1.  Form a C-Corporation by choosing a business name that complies with state requirements, filing Articles of Incorporation with the appropriate state agency, and paying the required filing fees.
2.  Create corporate bylaws that outline the company's structure and governance.
3.  Hold an organizational meeting to appoint directors and officers and adopt the bylaws.
4.  Obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS.
5.  Register for state and local taxes, licenses, and permits as needed.
6.  File Form 2553, "Election by a Small Business Corporation," with the IRS to elect S-Corp status.

## Taxation

S-Corps are not subject to corporate income tax. Instead, income, deductions, and credits flow through to shareholders, who report this information on their individual tax returns. Shareholders then pay taxes on their share of the corporation's income at their individual tax rates. S-Corps are still responsible for paying certain federal and state taxes, such as payroll taxes and state income taxes.
