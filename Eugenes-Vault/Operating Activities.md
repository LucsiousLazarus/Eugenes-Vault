## Overview

Operating activities are the day-to-day actions a company takes to carry out its business. They are the primary source of a company’s cash flows and represent the core of its business operations. These activities usually generate revenue and involve expenses.

In financial reporting, the cash flow from operating activities section on the [[Cash Flow Statement (CFS)]] reflects the net cash inflow (or outflow) from these activities.

## Examples of Operating Activities

Operating activities generally include:

1.  **Receipts from Sale of Goods and Services**: This is the primary source of cash inflow for a business.
    
2.  **Payments to Suppliers**: Businesses have to pay their suppliers for the raw materials or goods they purchase.
    
3.  **Payments to Employees**: This includes salaries, wages, and other benefits provided to the employees.
    
4.  **Interest and Taxes**: Companies have to pay interest on loans and taxes to the government.
    

## Importance of Operating Activities

The ability of a company to generate positive cash flow from operating activities is a key indicator of its financial health. Companies that consistently generate positive cash flows from their operating activities are generally seen as more stable and financially healthy.

In the analysis of a company’s financial statements, the cash flow from operating activities is examined closely as it directly indicates the company’s ability to generate sufficient cash to maintain and grow its operations.
