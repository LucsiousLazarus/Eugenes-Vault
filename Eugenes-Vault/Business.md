## Overview

A business is an organization or entity that engages in commercial, industrial, or professional activities to generate revenue. Businesses can be for-profit, non-profit, or a blend of both. They can range from small single-owner entities to large multinational corporations. The primary goal of most businesses is to create value for their owners, shareholders, or stakeholders.

## Types of Businesses

1.  **Sole Proprietorship**: A business owned and managed by a single individual. The owner has unlimited liability, and their personal assets can be used to satisfy business debts.
    
2.  **Partnership**: A business owned and managed by two or more individuals. There are different types of partnerships, including general, limited, and limited liability partnerships.
    
3.  **Corporation**: A separate legal entity owned by shareholders, which provides limited liability protection to its owners.
    
4.  **Limited Liability Company (LLC)**: A hybrid legal structure combining aspects of a corporation and a partnership, providing limited liability protection to its owners (called members).
    
5.  **Non-profit Organization**: A business that operates for the benefit of the public or a specific cause, rather than for the profit of its owners or shareholders.
    
6.  **Cooperative**: A business owned and operated by its members, who share profits and decision-making responsibilities.
