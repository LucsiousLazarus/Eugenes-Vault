## Overview

Inventory refers to the goods and materials that businesses hold in stock for the purpose of sale, production, or service provision. Proper inventory management is crucial for businesses, as it can impact profitability, cash flow, and operational efficiency. Balancing inventory levels involves managing the trade-off between carrying too much inventory, which can lead to increased costs and waste, and carrying too little inventory, which can result in stockouts and lost sales.

## Types of Inventory

1.  **Raw Materials**: The basic components and inputs used in the production process, such as metals, wood, or chemicals.
2.  **Work-in-Progress (WIP)**: Partially finished goods that are in the process of being transformed into final products through various stages of production.
3.  **Finished Goods**: Completed products ready for sale to customers, either directly or through distribution channels.
4.  **Merchandise**: Goods purchased by retailers or wholesalers from manufacturers, intended for resale to customers without further processing.

## Inventory Management Techniques

1.  **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)**: A mathematical formula used to determine the optimal order size that minimizes the total cost of ordering and holding inventory, considering factors such as order costs, holding costs, and demand.
2.  **Just-in-Time (JIT)**: An inventory management approach that aims to minimize inventory levels by coordinating production and delivery schedules with customer demand, reducing the need for holding large quantities of stock.
3.  **Safety Stock**: A buffer of extra inventory maintained to protect against uncertainties in demand or lead times, helping to prevent stockouts and maintain customer satisfaction.
4.  **Inventory Turnover**: A financial ratio that measures the number of times a company's inventory is sold and replaced during a given period, calculated as the cost of goods sold divided by average inventory. A higher inventory turnover indicates more efficient inventory management.

## Inventory Valuation Methods

Different inventory valuation methods can be used in accounting to determine the cost of goods sold and the value of inventory on the balance sheet:

1.  **First-In, First-Out (FIFO)**: Assumes that the oldest items in inventory are sold first, assigning the cost of the earliest purchased items to the cost of goods sold, while the remaining inventory is valued at the cost of the most recently purchased items.
2.  **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)**: Assumes that the newest items in inventory are sold first, assigning the cost of the most recently purchased items to the cost of goods sold, while the remaining inventory is valued at the cost of the earliest purchased items.
3.  **Weighted Average Cost**: Calculates the average cost of all items in inventory, taking into account their purchase prices and quantities, and assigns this average cost to both the cost of goods sold and the remaining inventory.

## Impact on Financial Statements

Inventory is an important component of a company's financial statements, as it affects:

1.  **Balance Sheet**: Inventory is reported as a current asset, representing the value of goods available for sale or use in production.
2.  **Income Statement**: The cost of goods sold, which is calculated based on the inventory valuation method used, impacts a company's gross profit and net income.
3.  **Cash Flow Statement**: Changes in inventory levels can affect a company's cash flow from operations, as increases in inventory represent cash outflows, while decreases in inventory represent cash inflows.
