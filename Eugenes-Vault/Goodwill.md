## Overview

[[Goodwill]] is an intangible asset that is associated with the purchase of one company by another. Specifically, it is the portion of the purchase price that is higher than the sum of the net fair value of all of the assets purchased in the acquisition and the liabilities assumed in the process.

## Calculation of Goodwill

Goodwill is calculated by taking the purchase price of a company and subtracting the net fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities.

Goodwill = Purchase Price - (Fair Value of Identifiable Assets - Fair Value of Liabilities)

## Impairment of Goodwill

Goodwill is not amortized like other intangible assets. Instead, companies must annually test it for impairment. If a company's acquired net assets fall below the recorded cost, a goodwill impairment occurs, and the company must write-down goodwill on its balance sheet.

In the case of a goodwill impairment, a company must recognize a loss in its income statement equal to the amount by which the recorded cost of goodwill exceeds the goodwill's fair value.

## Role in the Balance Sheet

Goodwill sits on the balance sheet as an asset, and it can inflate a company's apparent worth or total assets. As such, potential investors should consider the amount of goodwill, as well as the likelihood of impairments, when analyzing a company's financial health.

## Economic Interpretation

Goodwill often arises in acquisitions, where the purchasing company is willing to pay a premium for the target company due to factors such as the target's brand name, solid customer base, good customer relations, good employee relations, and any patents or proprietary technology.
