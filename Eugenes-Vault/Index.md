## Overview

An index is a statistical measure of the performance of a specific group of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or commodities. It serves as a benchmark to track the performance of various financial markets or sectors, allowing investors to gauge the overall market sentiment and compare the performance of individual investments.

## Types of Indices

There are various types of indices, including:

1.  **[[Stock market indices]]**: These indices track the performance of a group of stocks, typically from a specific stock exchange, sector, or geographical region. Examples include the S&P 500 (US large-cap stocks), the NASDAQ Composite (US technology stocks), and the Nikkei 225 (Japanese stocks).
    
2.  **[[Bond indices]]**: These indices measure the performance of a group of bonds, typically segmented by issuer type (government, corporate, or municipal), credit quality, or maturity. Examples include the Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index (US investment-grade bonds) and the J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index (emerging market sovereign bonds).
    
3.  **[[Commodity indices]]**: These indices track the performance of a basket of commodities, often focusing on specific categories such as energy, metals, or agriculture. Examples include the S&P GSCI (diversified commodity index) and the Bloomberg Commodity Index (investable commodity index).
    
4.  **[[Real estate indices]]**: These indices measure the performance of real estate investments, such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) or property indices. Examples include the FTSE Nareit All REITs Index (US REITs) and the MSCI US REIT Index (US equity REITs).
    

## Index Construction

Indices can be constructed using various methodologies, such as:

1.  **[[Price-weighted indices]]**: The index is calculated based on the price of each component, with higher-priced assets having a greater influence on the index value. Example: Dow Jones Industrial Average.
    
2.  **[[Market capitalization-weighted indices]]**: The index is calculated based on the market capitalization of each component, with larger companies having a greater influence on the index value. Example: S&P 500.
    
3.  **[[Equal-weighted indices]]**: Each component is assigned an equal weight in the index, regardless of its price or market capitalization. Example: Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF.
    
4.  **[[Fundamental-weighted indices]]**: The index is calculated based on the fundamental characteristics of each component, such as revenue, earnings, or dividends. Example: WisdomTree U.S. Dividend Growth Fund.
    

## Investing in Indices

Investors can gain exposure to indices through various financial products, including:

1.  **[[Index funds]]**: Mutual funds or Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) that aim to replicate the performance of a specific index by holding its underlying components in the same proportion as the index.
    
2.  **[[Index futures]]**: Futures contracts that allow investors to speculate on the future performance of an index or hedge their existing investments against potential market fluctuations.
    
3.  **[[Index Option]]s**: Options contracts that give investors the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell an index at a specified price on or before a specific date.
    
4.  **[[Index-linked securities]]**: Financial instruments, such as bonds or structured products, whose returns are linked to the performance of a specific index.
