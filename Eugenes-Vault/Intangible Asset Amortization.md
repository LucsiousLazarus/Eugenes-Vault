## Overview

[[Intangible Asset Amortization]] is a process that gradually charges the cost of an intangible asset to expense over its estimated useful life. Like depreciation for tangible assets, amortization is a method used to write off the cost of a long-term asset over its useful life, reflecting the consumption or usage of the asset.

## Characteristics of Intangible Asset Amortization

Here are the key characteristics:

1. **Non-cash expense:** Similar to depreciation, amortization is a non-cash expense. It does not involve a cash outflow; rather, it's an accounting method to allocate the cost of intangible assets over their useful lives.
    
2. **Reduced book value:** Amortization gradually reduces the book value of the intangible asset on the balance sheet.
    
3. **Income Statement impact:** The amortization expense is recorded on the income statement and reduces the company's net income.
    

## Accounting for Intangible Asset Amortization

In the accounting for intangible assets, the following steps are usually observed:

1. Determine the cost of the intangible asset: This includes all costs necessary to make the intangible asset ready for its intended use.
    
2. Estimate the useful life of the intangible asset: The life of an intangible asset can be either finite or indefinite. Only those with finite lives are amortized.
    
3. Calculate the amortization expense: This is usually done using the straight-line method, which means the cost is divided by the useful life, resulting in the same expense each year.
    

## Example of Intangible Asset Amortization

Consider a company that has purchased a patent for $1,000,000, and it has a useful life of 10 years. The yearly amortization expense would be $100,000 ($1,000,000 divided by 10 years).
