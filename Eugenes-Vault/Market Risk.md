## Overview

Market risk, also known as systematic risk, refers to the potential for losses in investments due to changes in market conditions, such as fluctuations in interest rates, exchange rates, equity prices, or commodity prices. Market risk cannot be eliminated through diversification, as it affects all investments within a market or asset class. It is an essential factor for investors, portfolio managers, and financial institutions to consider when managing risk and making investment decisions.

## Types of Market Risk

1.  **Equity risk**: The risk of losses due to changes in stock prices, which can be influenced by factors such as economic conditions, corporate performance, and investor sentiment.
2.  **Interest rate risk**: The risk of losses resulting from changes in interest rates, which can impact the value of fixed-income investments, such as bonds and loans.
3.  **Currency risk**: The risk of losses due to fluctuations in exchange rates, which can affect the value of investments denominated in foreign currencies.
4.  **Commodity risk**: The risk of losses resulting from changes in commodity prices, such as oil, gold, or agricultural products, which can impact various industries and investments.

## Measuring Market Risk

1.  **Standard deviation**: A measure of an investment's historical volatility, used to quantify the degree of price fluctuation over time.
2.  **Beta**: A measure of an investment's sensitivity to market movements, with a higher beta indicating a higher level of systematic risk.
3.  **Value at Risk (VaR)**: A statistical measure that estimates the maximum potential loss an investment or portfolio could experience over a specific time horizon, with a given probability level.
4.  **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**: A risk measure that estimates the expected loss in the worst-case scenarios, beyond the VaR threshold.

## Managing Market Risk

1.  **Diversification**: Spreading investments across various asset classes, sectors, and geographies can help reduce the impact of market risk on a portfolio.
2.  **Asset allocation**: Strategic allocation of assets in a portfolio, based on factors such as risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals, can help manage market risk.
3.  **Hedging**: Implementing hedging strategies, such as using derivatives (e.g., options, futures, or swaps), can help reduce exposure to specific market risks.
4.  **Dynamic risk management**: Continuously monitoring and adjusting a portfolio's risk profile, based on changing market conditions and risk factors, can help manage market risk over time.

## Market Risk and Regulation

Financial regulators and central banks play a crucial role in overseeing market risk management by financial institutions. Regulatory frameworks, such as the Basel Accords, establish guidelines and requirements for capital adequacy, stress testing, and risk management practices to help ensure the stability of the financial system.
