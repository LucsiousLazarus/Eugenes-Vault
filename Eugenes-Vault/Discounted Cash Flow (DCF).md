## Overview

[[Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)]] is a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of an investment opportunity. DCF analysis uses future free cash flow projections and discounts them, using a required annual rate, to arrive at present value estimates. If the present value arrived at through DCF analysis is higher than the current cost of the investment, the opportunity may be a good one.

## Calculating DCF

The basic formula for DCF is:

`DCF = CF1/(1+r) + CF2/(1+r)^2 + CF3/(1+r)^3 + ... + CFn/(1+r)^n`

Where:

- DCF is the discounted cash flow
- CF is the cash flow for the given year
- r is the discount rate
- n is the year

## Steps in DCF Analysis

1. **Projecting Free Cash Flow**: Determine the entity's free cash flows. This typically involves detailed financial modeling and forecasting.
    
2. **Estimating the Discount Rate**: The discount rate is typically the required rate of return for the investor. This could be the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for a firm, or a desired rate of return.
    
3. **Calculating the Present Value of Future Cash Flows**: Using the discount rate, calculate the present value of each year's projected cash flow.
    
4. **Determining the Terminal Value**: The terminal value represents the value of the entity beyond the projection period and is also discounted back to the present value.
    
5. **Summing the PVs to Arrive at DCF**: The sum of the present values of the projected cash flows and terminal value gives the estimated DCF.
    

## Advantages and Disadvantages of DCF

**Advantages**:

- Focus on Cash Flow: DCF relies on cash flows, which are harder to manipulate than other financial metrics, making DCF a relatively reliable method.
    
- Long-Term View: DCF takes a long-term view of performance and value, reflecting the total value of projected cash flows.
    

**Disadvantages**:

- Dependence on Assumptions: DCF relies heavily on assumptions about long-term growth and discount rates. Small changes in these assumptions can result in large variations in the calculated value.
    
- Not Suitable for Certain Firms: DCF can be less reliable for firms without predictable cash flows or those with irregular cash flows.
