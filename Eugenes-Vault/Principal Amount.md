## Overview

The principal amount, also referred to as the principal, is the original amount of a loan or mortgage that a borrower agrees to repay to the lender. The principal does not include any interest or fees that may be charged as part of the loan agreement. Over time, as the borrower makes payments, the principal amount will decrease until it is completely paid off.

## Principal vs. Interest

In most loans and mortgages, the borrower's periodic payments consist of both principal and interest. The interest portion is calculated based on the outstanding principal balance and the interest rate, while the principal portion is the difference between the total payment and the interest payment. As the borrower makes payments, the principal balance decreases, leading to lower interest charges and a higher proportion of the payment being applied to the principal.

## Amortization

Amortization is the process of gradually reducing the principal balance of a loan or mortgage through a series of periodic payments. An amortization schedule is a table that details the breakdown of each payment into principal and interest portions over the life of the loan. Early in the repayment period, the majority of the payment is allocated to interest, but as the principal balance decreases, a larger portion of each payment goes toward reducing the principal.

## Principal Amount and Loan Term

The principal amount, along with the interest rate and the loan term, determines the monthly payment for a loan or mortgage. A higher principal amount generally results in higher monthly payments. Similarly, a longer loan term may result in lower monthly payments, as the principal is spread out over a greater number of payments. However, a longer loan term can also lead to higher total interest paid over the life of the loan.

## Prepayments and Principal Reduction

Borrowers may have the option to make additional payments to reduce the principal balance of a loan or mortgage more quickly. These prepayments can help save money by reducing the total interest paid over the life of the loan. Some loan agreements may include prepayment penalties or fees, so it is important to review the terms of the loan before making additional principal payments.
