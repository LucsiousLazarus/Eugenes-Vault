## Overview

Preferred stock is a type of equity security that represents ownership in a company, ranking between common stock and debt securities in the company's capital structure. Preferred shares have characteristics of both debt and equity, offering unique advantages and disadvantages to both issuers and investors.

## Key Characteristics

### 1. Dividends

-   **Fixed dividends**: Preferred stock usually pays a fixed dividend, which is determined as a percentage of the par value or as a specific amount per share.
-   **Cumulative dividends**: Many preferred shares have a cumulative feature, which means that any unpaid dividends accumulate and must be paid before any dividends can be paid to common shareholders.
-   **Priority**: Preferred shareholders have priority over common shareholders when it comes to receiving dividends.

### 2. Liquidation Preference

-   **Higher claim**: In the event of a company's liquidation or bankruptcy, preferred shareholders have a higher claim on the company's assets than common shareholders, but they rank below bondholders and other debt holders.
-   **Fixed liquidation value**: Preferred shares typically have a fixed liquidation value, which is the amount that will be paid to preferred shareholders before any proceeds are distributed to common shareholders.

### 3. Voting Rights

-   **Limited voting rights**: Preferred stockholders usually have limited or no voting rights compared to common stockholders. However, they may have the right to vote on specific issues, such as changes to the company's articles of incorporation that could negatively affect their rights as preferred shareholders.

### 4. Convertibility

-   **Convertible preferred stock**: Some preferred shares can be converted into common stock at a predetermined ratio and conversion price. This feature allows preferred shareholders to benefit from potential increases in the value of the common stock.

### 5. Callable

-   **Callable feature**: Issuers may have the option to call or redeem preferred shares at a specified call price, usually at or above the par value, after a certain date. This allows companies to take advantage of lower interest rates or improve their capital structure by reducing their outstanding preferred stock.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

-   **Steady income**: Preferred stock provides investors with a relatively steady stream of income through fixed dividends.
-   **Higher claim on assets**: Preferred shareholders have a higher claim on the company's assets and earnings than common shareholders, which can provide a greater level of protection in the event of liquidation.
-   **Potential for capital appreciation**: Convertible preferred shares offer the potential for capital appreciation if the underlying common stock increases in value.

### Disadvantages

-   **Limited upside potential**: Preferred dividends are usually fixed, which means that preferred shareholders may not benefit from significant increases in the company's earnings or the value of its common stock.
-   **Interest rate sensitivity**: Because preferred stock pays fixed dividends, its market value can be sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates rise, the value of preferred shares may decline.
