## Overview

A startup is a young company founded by one or more entrepreneurs to develop a unique product or service and bring it to market. Startups are usually characterized by high uncertainty, innovative offerings, growth potential, and a business model that aims for scale. The primary purpose of a startup is to grow rapidly as a result of offering something that addresses a particular market gap.

## Characteristics of a Startup

1.  **Innovation**: Startups are often focused on bringing new products or services to the market or doing it in a unique, disruptive way.
    
2.  **Scalability**: Startups aim for rapid growth and wide market reach. They leverage scalable business models and technologies that allow for high growth with minimal incremental cost.
    
3.  **Uncertainty**: Startups operate under significant uncertainty, particularly in their early stages. They face uncertainty about their product, market, or business model.
    
4.  **Funding**: Many startups rely on external funding sources, such as [[Venture Capital (VC)]] and [[Angel Investing]], due to high initial costs and lack of revenue in the early stages.
    
5.  **Exit Strategy**: Most startups have a plan for an exit strategy, which might include being acquired by a larger company or going public through an initial public offering (IPO).
    

## Startup Lifecycle

1.  **Idea stage**: At this point, the entrepreneur has a business idea but may not have fully tested or developed it.
    
2.  **Development stage**: The entrepreneur develops the product or service, often building a minimum viable product (MVP) for market testing.
    
3.  **Market testing**: The startup tests its product in the market, looking for product-market fit.
    
4.  **Scale-up**: Once the product-market fit is established, the startup aims to scale its operations quickly.
    
5.  **Maturity or Exit**: Eventually, the startup reaches a maturity stage, or the founders exit the business through a sale or IPO.
