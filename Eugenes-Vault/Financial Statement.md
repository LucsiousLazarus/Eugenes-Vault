## Overview

A financial statement is a formal record of the financial activities and position of a [[Business]], person, or other entity. It provides a snapshot of an entity's financial health and performance over a specific period. Financial statements are crucial for making informed decisions by [[Investor]]s, [[Creditor]]s, [[Regulator]]s, and other [[Stakeholder]]s. The three primary financial statements are the [[Balance Sheet]], [[Income Statement]], and [[Cash Flow Statement]].

## [[Balance Sheet]]

The balance sheet, also known as the statement of financial position, presents a company's assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time. It adheres to the accounting equation:

[[Asset]]s = [[Liabilities]] + [[Equity]]

1.  **[[Asset]]s:** Resources owned or controlled by a company that are expected to provide future economic benefits.
2.  **[[Liabilities]]:** Obligations a company owes to others, such as loans, accounts payable, and accrued expenses.
3.  **[[Equity]]:** The residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting liabilities, representing the owners' claim on the company's assets.

## [[Income Statement]]

The income statement, also known as the [[Profit and Loss Statement (P&L)]] or Statement of Sperations, summarizes a [[Company]]'s [[Revenue]]s, [[Expense]]s, and [[Net Income]] or loss over a specific period. It reflects the [[Company]]'s ability to generate [[Profit]]s by increasing [[Revenue]]s, controlling [[Expense]]s, or both.

1.  **[[Revenue]]s:** The [[Income]] generated from the sale of [[Good]]s and [[Service]]s or other business activities.
2.  **[[Expense]]s:** The [[Cost]]s incurred to generate [[Revenue]]s, such as [[Cost]] of [[Good]]s sold, [[Operating Expense]]s, and [[Tax]]es.
3.  **[[Net Income]] (Loss):** The difference between [[Revenue]]s and [[Expense]]s, representing the [[Company]]'s [[Profit]]ability or lack thereof.

## [[Cash Flow Statement]]

The [[Cash Flow Statement]] reports a [[Company]]'s inflows and outflows of [[Cash]] and [[Cash Equivalent]] over a specific period. It provides insight into a [[Company]]'s ability to generate and use [[Cash]] to meet its obligations, invest in its future, and return value to its owners. The [[Cash Flow Statement]] is divided into three sections:

1.  **[[Operating Activities]]:** [[Cash Flow]]s related to the Company's core business operations, such as revenues and expenses.
2.  **[[Investing Activities]]:** [[Cash Flow]]s related to the [[Acquisition]] and disposal of long-term [[Asset]]s and [[Investment]]s.
3.  **[[Financing Activities]]:** [[Cash Flow]]s related to the issuance and repayment of [[Debt]], [[Equity Financing]], and [[Dividend]] payments.

## Importance of Financial Statements

Financial statements are essential for various reasons:

1.  **Decision-making:** [[Investor]]s, [[Creditor]]s, and management use financial statements to make informed decisions about the [[Company]]'s performance and financial health.
2.  **Compliance:** Companies are required to prepare financial statements to comply with regulatory requirements and accounting standards.
3.  **Transparency:** Financial statements provide transparency into a [[Company]]'s operations, helping to build trust among [[Stakeholder]]s.
4.  **Benchmarking:** Financial statements allow for comparisons between companies, industries, and time periods, enabling [[Stakeholder]]s to evaluate a [[Company]]'s performance relative to its peers.
