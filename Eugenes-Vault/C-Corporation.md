## Overview

A C-Corporation (C-Corp) is a legal business structure in the United States that is separate from its owners. It is one of the most common types of corporations and is subject to federal and state corporate income taxes. C-Corps can have an unlimited number of shareholders, making it suitable for larger companies and those seeking to raise capital through the issuance of stock.

## Key Features

1.  **Limited Liability**: Shareholders' personal assets are protected from the corporation's debts and liabilities.
2.  **Separate Legal Entity**: A C-Corp is a separate legal entity from its owners, allowing it to enter into contracts, own property, and sue or be sued.
3.  **Perpetual Existence**: A C-Corp can continue indefinitely, regardless of changes in ownership.
4.  **Stock Issuance**: C-Corps can issue multiple classes of stock, allowing them to raise capital from investors.
5.  **Transferable Ownership**: Shares in a C-Corp are easily transferable, making it simple for owners to sell their stake in the company.
6.  **Double Taxation**: C-Corps face double taxation, as both the corporation and its shareholders are taxed on the company's profits.

## Formation Process

To form a C-Corporation, the following steps must be taken:

1.  Choose a business name that complies with state requirements.
2.  File Articles of Incorporation with the appropriate state agency.
3.  Pay the required filing fees.
4.  Create corporate bylaws that outline the company's structure and governance.
5.  Hold an organizational meeting to appoint directors and officers and adopt the bylaws.
6.  Obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS.
7.  Register for state and local taxes, licenses, and permits as needed.

## Taxation

C-Corps are subject to double taxation, meaning the corporation pays taxes on its profits at the corporate level, and shareholders pay taxes on their dividends at the individual level. The corporate tax rate in the United States is a flat rate of 21%. Individual tax rates for dividends vary depending on the shareholder's income and tax bracket.

3.  Transferable ownership
4.  Perpetual existence
