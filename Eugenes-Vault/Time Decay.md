## Overview

[[Time Decay]], also known as Theta, is a term used in the world of finance that refers to the rate at which the value of an [[Options|option]] decreases over time, holding all other inputs constant. It's one of the key components of options pricing models.

## Understanding Time Decay

- All else being equal, an option will lose value as time approaches its expiration date, which is the effect of time decay. This is due to the decreasing likelihood that the option will finish in-the-money, i.e., have an intrinsic value greater than zero at expiry.
    
- Time decay is nonlinear and accelerates as the optionâ€™s expiration date approaches. This is often referred to as the "time decay curve".
    
- Time Decay affects both Call Options and Put Options. Both types of options will lose a part of their value as time passes.
    

## The Concept of Theta

- [[Theta]] is a measure of time decay. It is one of the Greek letters used by options traders to describe how the passage of one day affects the value of an option.
    
- Theta is typically negative for purchased options, and positive for sold options.
    
- A Theta of -0.02, for example, would indicate that the option's price will drop by $0.02 per day, all else being equal.
    

## Time Decay and Strategy

- Option sellers benefit from time decay because the options they have sold will decrease in value as time passes, allowing them to potentially buy them back at a lower price.
    
- Conversely, option buyers are disadvantaged by time decay. The options they have purchased will decrease in value as time passes, which means they must move into the money to maintain their value.
    
- Understanding the impact of time decay is critical when deciding on a particular options strategy. Some strategies, such as writing covered calls or selling puts, can take advantage of time decay.
