## Overview

Compounding refers to the process by which an investment's earnings, from either capital gains or interest, are reinvested to generate additional earnings over time. This results in the exponential growth of the original investment amount, as the earnings are continuously reinvested.

## Compound Interest

Compound interest is the interest on a loan or deposit that is calculated based on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. The formula for compound interest is:

A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)

-   A: the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
-   P: the principal investment/loan amount
-   r: annual interest rate (in decimal)
-   n: number of times that interest is compounded per year
-   t: time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years

## Compounding Periods

Compounding can occur on any given frequency schedule, from daily to annually, depending on the specific terms. The more frequently the interest is compounded, the greater the overall return will be.

1.  **Annual Compounding**: Interest is calculated and added to the investment once per year.
2.  **Semi-Annual Compounding**: Interest is calculated and added twice per year.
3.  **Quarterly Compounding**: Interest is calculated and added four times per year.
4.  **Monthly Compounding**: Interest is calculated and added twelve times per year.
5.  **Daily Compounding**: Interest is calculated and added every day.

## Impact of Compounding

Compounding has a significant impact on the growth of investments:

1.  **Time**: The longer the investment period, the more significant the compounding effect, as there's more time for earnings to be reinvested and generate additional earnings.
2.  **Interest Rate**: Higher interest rates lead to more substantial compounding effects, as the investment generates more earnings to be reinvested.
3.  **Frequency of Compounding**: The more frequently interest is compounded, the larger the compounding effect, as the investment has more opportunities to grow.

## Applications of Compounding

1.  **Investing**: Investors use the power of compounding to grow their investments over time. This is why it's often recommended to start investing early.
2.  **Loans**: Lenders use compounding to calculate the interest on loans, which can significantly increase the amount owed over time.
3.  **Savings**: Banks often use compounding to calculate interest on savings accounts, which can help individuals grow their savings over time.
