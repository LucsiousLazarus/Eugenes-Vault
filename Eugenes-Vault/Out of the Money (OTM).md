## Overview

Out of the Money (OTM) is a term used in options trading to describe an option contract that does not have intrinsic value. An option is considered OTM when the strike price of the option is not favorable compared to the current market price of the underlying asset. OTM options are less likely to be exercised, as they do not offer any immediate profit to the option holder when exercised.

## [[Call Option]]s

A call option is OTM when the strike price is above the current market price of the underlying asset. In this situation, exercising the option would mean buying the asset at a higher price than the market value, resulting in a loss for the option holder.

**Example**: An investor holds a call option on Company XYZ with a strike price of $50. If the current market price of Company XYZ's stock is $45, the call option is OTM.

## [[Put Option]]s

A put option is OTM when the strike price is below the current market price of the underlying asset. In this case, exercising the option would mean selling the asset at a lower price than the market value, leading to a loss for the option holder.

**Example**: An investor holds a put option on Company XYZ with a strike price of $50. If the current market price of Company XYZ's stock is $55, the put option is OTM.

## [[Intrinsic Value]]

OTM options do not have intrinsic value, as they would not result in any profit if exercised. Instead, their value is derived solely from their time value and extrinsic factors such as implied volatility.

## Relationship with [[Time Value]]

OTM options typically have a lower premium compared to in-the-money (ITM) or at-the-money (ATM) options, as they do not possess intrinsic value. However, their time value can still be significant, especially for options with longer expiration dates.

## Trading Implications

OTM options are often used in speculative strategies, as they offer higher potential returns due to their lower premiums. However, they also have a higher probability of expiring worthless, resulting in a loss for the option buyer. Traders and investors may use OTM options for strategies such as vertical spreads, strangles, and straddles to capitalize on changes in an underlying asset's price or volatility.
