## Overview

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are a set of guidelines, standards, and procedures that public companies in the United States must follow when preparing and presenting their financial statements. GAAP is intended to promote consistency, transparency, and comparability in financial reporting, making it easier for investors, regulators, and other stakeholders to evaluate and compare the financial performance of companies.

GAAP is established and maintained by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), an independent, non-profit organization responsible for setting accounting standards in the United States.

## Key Principles of GAAP

1.  **Revenue Recognition:** Revenue should be recognized when it is earned and realizable, which typically occurs when goods or services have been provided to the customer.
2.  **Expense Recognition (Matching Principle):** Expenses should be recognized in the same period as the revenues they helped to generate, ensuring that financial statements accurately reflect a company's profitability.
3.  **Historical Cost:** Assets should be recorded at their original cost, not their current market value. This principle aims to minimize the impact of market fluctuations on financial statements.
4.  **Materiality:** Financial statements should include all information that is material, meaning that its omission or misstatement could influence the decisions of users of the financial statements.
5.  **Conservatism:** In situations where there are uncertainties or multiple acceptable accounting methods, accountants should choose the method that is least likely to overstate assets or income and most likely to understate liabilities or expenses.
6.  **Consistency:** The same accounting methods and policies should be applied consistently from one accounting period to another, making it easier for users to compare financial statements over time.
7.  **Full Disclosure:** Financial statements should include all relevant information necessary for users to understand a company's financial condition and performance, including appropriate footnotes and disclosures.

## Major Financial Statements Under GAAP

1.  **Balance Sheet:** A snapshot of a company's financial position at a specific point in time, showing its assets, liabilities, and owners' equity.
2.  **Income Statement:** A summary of a company's revenues, expenses, and net income or loss over a specific period, usually a fiscal year or quarter.
3.  **Statement of Cash Flows:** A report showing a company's cash inflows and outflows from operating, investing, and financing activities over a specific period.
4.  **Statement of Changes in Equity:** A summary of the changes in a company's equity accounts, including retained earnings and owners' contributions, over a specific period.

## GAAP vs. IFRS

The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are a set of accounting standards developed by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) for use by companies in countries outside the United States. While both GAAP and IFRS aim to ensure consistent and transparent financial reporting, there are some differences in their principles and requirements.

Some of the main differences between GAAP and IFRS include:

-   **Flexibility:** IFRS generally provides more flexibility and allows for more professional judgment than GAAP, which tends to be more rules-based and prescriptive.
-   **Inventory Costing:** GAAP allows for the use of the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) method of inventory costing, while IFRS does not.
-   **Revenue Recognition:** IFRS has a single, principles-based standard for revenue recognition, while GAAP has multiple, industry-specific revenue recognition guidelines.
-   **Intangible Assets:** IFRS generally allows for the revaluation of intangible assets, while GAAP does not.
