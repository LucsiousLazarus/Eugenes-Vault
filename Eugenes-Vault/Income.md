## Overview

Income is money that an individual, business, or economy receives in exchange for providing a good or service or through investing capital. It can be earned through work, investments, and other methods. It serves as a significant part of economic health, individual financial status, and business profitability.

## Types of Income

Income can be classified into several categories:

1.  **Earned Income**: This type of income is earned from work. It includes wages, salaries, bonuses, commissions, tips, and net earnings from self-employment.
    
2.  **Investment Income (or Unearned Income)**: This type of income is received from investments like dividends, interest, or rent. Income generated from selling an investment at a profit, known as a capital gain, is also considered unearned income.
    
3.  **Passive Income**: This is income generated from business activities in which an individual does not actively participate, such as income from rental properties or royalties.
    
4.  **Other Income**: This may include social security benefits, pensions, state disability insurance, unemployment benefits, welfare payments, public assistance, annuities, or lottery winnings.
    

## Income in Business

In the context of business, income (often referred to as net income or net earnings) is the company's total earnings or profit. In other words, income is what remains of revenue after the company pays all its expenses, interest on its debts, and taxes.

## Income and Personal Finance

For individuals, managing income is a key aspect of personal finance. It's important to balance income with expenses and to save or invest any surplus income to build wealth over time.
