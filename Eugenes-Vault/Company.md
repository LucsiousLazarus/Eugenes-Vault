## Overview

A company is a legal entity formed by one or more individuals or organizations to engage in business activities, such as producing goods or providing services. Companies are designed to separate the business's assets and liabilities from those of its owners, offering limited liability protection. Companies can be organized in various ways, depending on their legal structure, ownership, size, and industry.

## Key Concepts

1.  **Legal Entity**: A company is a separate legal entity from its owners, which means it can enter into contracts, own property, and sue or be sued in its own name. This separation provides limited liability protection for the owners, who are not personally responsible for the company's debts and obligations (unless they have provided personal guarantees).
    
2.  **Ownership**: A company's ownership is represented by shares, which are units of equity that can be bought, sold, or transferred among individuals or organizations. Shareholders are the owners of a company, and their ownership interest is proportional to the number of shares they hold.
    
3.  **Management**: The day-to-day management of a company is typically handled by its directors and officers, who are responsible for making decisions, setting strategy, and overseeing operations. Directors are elected by shareholders, while officers (such as the CEO, CFO, and COO) are appointed by the board of directors.
    
4.  **Corporate Structure**: There are various types of corporate structures, each with its own legal, tax, and regulatory implications. Common structures include:
    
    -   [[Sole Proprietorship]]: A business owned and operated by a single individual, with no legal distinction between the owner and the business.
    -   [[Partnership]]: A business owned by two or more individuals or entities, who share in the profits, losses, and management responsibilities.
    -   [[Corporation]]: A separate legal entity owned by shareholders, which offers limited liability protection and may be subject to different tax treatment.
    -   [[Limited Liability Company (LLC)]]: A hybrid structure that combines the limited liability protection of a corporation with the tax and management flexibility of a partnership.
5.  **Financial Reporting**: Companies are required to maintain financial records and prepare financial statements, which provide an overview of their financial performance and position. Publicly traded companies, in particular, must comply with strict financial reporting standards and regulations to ensure transparency and investor confidence.

They also provide a framework for entrepreneurship and innovation, allowing individuals and organizations to pool resources, share risks, and capitalize on opportunities.
