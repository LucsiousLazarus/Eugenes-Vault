## Overview

The Discounted Payback Period (DPB) is a capital budgeting procedure used to determine the profitability of a project. Unlike the simple payback period, the discounted payback period takes the time value of money into consideration. It calculates the time it takes for the present value of future cash flows to equal or exceed the initial investment.

## Calculation

The formula for calculating the Discounted Payback Period is:

DPB = Sum (t * PV(CFt))

Where:

- DPB = Discounted Payback Period
- t = Time period
- PV(CFt) = Present value of cash flow at time t

The present value (PV) of future cash flows is calculated using the formula:

PV(CFt) = CFt / (1+r)^t

Where:

- CFt = Cash flow in time period t
- r = Discount rate
- t = Time period

## Significance in Investment Analysis

The discounted payback period is a more valid measure of investment efficiency than the regular payback period because it accounts for time value of money - a fundamental concept in finance that money available today is worth more than the same amount of money in the future.

In essence, this method adjusts future cash flows to reflect the fact that money earned in the future will not have the same purchasing power as today due to inflation and investment risk.

If the discounted payback period of a project is less than the project's lifespan, the project might be considered a good investment, as it is likely to pay back the initial outlay before the end of its economic life.

However, like all investment appraisal methods, the discounted payback period method has its drawbacks. For example, it ignores any benefits that occur after the payback period and might not accurately reflect the project risk.
