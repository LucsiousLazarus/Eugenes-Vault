## Overview

The Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) represents a firm's average after-tax cost of capital from all sources, including common stock, preferred stock, bonds, and any other long-term debt. In other words, it is the average rate that a company is expected to pay to finance its assets.

## Calculation

The WACC is calculated by multiplying the cost of each capital source (debt and equity) by its relative weight, and then summing:

WACC = (E/V) * Ke + (D/V) * Kd * (1 - Tax rate)

where:

-   E = market value of equity
-   V = total market value of equity and debt
-   Ke = cost of equity
-   D = market value of debt
-   Kd = cost of debt

The WACC calculation takes into account the relative weights of each component of the capital structure and presents the expected cost of new capital for a firm.

## Use

The WACC is widely used in finance for several purposes:

-   In investment appraisal to discount future cash flows back to their present value
-   As a hurdle rate against which to assess ROI on investment decisions
-   To understand the feasibility of an investment from the perspective of the minimum required rate of return

## Limitations

While useful, the WACC has limitations:

-   It assumes that the companyâ€™s financial structure, business risk, and growth rate will remain constant.
-   It is a forward-looking measure and the actual cost of capital may be different.
-   Calculating the cost of equity includes a degree of subjectivity as it is not directly observable in the market.
