## Overview

A [[Swap]] is a derivative contract through which two parties exchange financial instruments or cash flows. The swaps market is crucial for risk management, enabling entities to hedge against various types of risk, such as interest rate risk, currency risk, and credit risk.

## Types of Swaps

The most common types of swap agreements include:

1. **Interest Rate Swap:** Two parties exchange interest payments, typically one at a fixed rate and one at a floating rate.
    
2. **Currency Swap:** Two parties exchange a certain amount of two different currencies initially and repay over time according to agreed upon terms.
    
3. **Commodity Swap:** One party agrees to pay a fixed price for a commodity, and the other party agrees to pay a floating rate tied to the actual market price of the commodity.
    
4. **Credit Default Swap:** One party pays another party in exchange for protection against the default of a third party.
    

## Swap Pricing

The pricing of a swap agreement is complex and depends on various factors, such as the present value of expected future cash flows, prevailing market conditions, and the creditworthiness of the parties involved.

## Swap Risks

Participants in a swap agreement are exposed to several types of risk, including [[Counterparty Risk]] (the risk that the other party will default), [[Market Risk]] (the risk of losses due to changes in market conditions), and [[Operational Risk]] (risks related to administrative or procedural errors).

## Legal Framework

Swap agreements are typically governed by an ISDA Master Agreement or similar agreement. This agreement sets out the general terms and conditions under which individual swap transactions occur.
